"Welcome back to another episode of Add To Cart, I’m auntie Kuku Vilaysack."
"And I’m Auntie Susu Park."
"Su, I’m so excited for our guests today. He’s a friend of mine and the other half of XOXO Gossip Kings along with Mr. Sweet Treat Carl Tart. He is an actor, writer, comedian, and he’s got a new music album to promote. He’s been a writer on Grand Cru new growth Brooklyn 99 and Single Parents. His new album highly sensitive person is out now please add to cart, Lamar Woods."
"That was good, thank y’all for having me, man. I’m like so excited to be here. I’ve been waiting, they put this one early in the month. I was like, man, it’s coming up soon. I know what’s coming, as I was."
"Already an anti fashion. When before we even started the recording. Ku, was already trying to fix the lighting in your room to light up your angel eyes, weren’t you?"
"He has gorgeous eyes."
"I know that. She’s like, I can’t see your beautiful face. Also, why are you blurring your background. I can’t see your beautiful one bedroom apartment. That barren apartment. Also, I didn’t know Yakata Carl, sweet treat, too. That’s crazy."
"Well, because he told us about how he loves a sweet treat at night."
"That’s true, yeah, he’s a he has a sweet."
"I’ve never known anybody to eat more birthday cake slices. I still think about."
"Slices of cake, and he picks one up every week."
"But I thank you for saying I have pretty eyes though, I appreciate that. That is my favorite attribute. I was with my therapist last week and I did this really cool thing where this cool thing. But like sometimes I just be making shit up, like this is what I would do if I was a therapist. I was like let’s write down all the things that I get insecure about when when a girl rejects me. And I wonder like because I’m not insecure about them all the time, only when you get rejected they all come out right? So we just wrapped I just we just made it list and we’re gonna go every week we’re going to talk about each one and try to figure out how to like not like fall slave to those insecurities."
"Wow, New York Times, best seller number one straight to the top, Self Help."
"Wait, you’re right, Su."
"Straight to the top. Let me tell you how to be a therapist. We’re just workshopping titles, we’re just workshopping."
"Yeah, what do you think?"
"It’s good, it’s good."
"Su, as absolutely right. I want you to be journaling about this, taking notes about this because this could be a book."
"Really, yeah."
"Like I’m being serious, like, just do it for the sake of doing it. Yes, I’m getting serious."
"Because when I told my therapist I was she was like, oh, that’s a good idea."
"And she’s writing it, right now."
"She did tell me just like I’m working, I’m trying to figure out I want to write a book but I don’t want to write about yeah. Oh, no, right pretty eyes is obviously not on that list so being short was on that list. I never felt like a short guy. I don’t seem short. Well, I guess I’m on that on a zooms, I don’t know, anyway, it was was talking about shopping. So I told you, I’d talk to you today so I’m just gonna start blabbing around likes to start talking because I’m like, oh, this human beings but yeah, so we’re gonna go through each one, that’s a good idea. I’m not going to talk about it no more. That’s my book. That’s what I’m gonna do. Because they only you only feel, I mean, some of them you feel them a lot but like when you get rejected, they take over and become powerful. So we got to figure out how to how to like break them down each one and where they come from to like, okay, maybe height comes from playing sports in school, high school, and being the smallest kid on the team. And that’s a source of insecurity for me, because I never was never successful in that, or something. Oh, yeah, I’m writing a book, right so let’s go."
"Look at this."
"Okay, well, this feels like the perfect transition to talk about your album, Highly Sensitive Person. But wait, let’s we should pause real quick, like why am I even talking right now? I mean, this is our first Add To Cart music cue interview. We’re gonna listen to some of your songs. We’re going to ask you questions. But again, why am I talking when we have a veteran MTV News person in our midst?"
"You just shoved me under the bus anytime. She just a little tap in the back and I go falling in a puddle careening under a bus."
"Lamar she’s interviewed, Usher in the studio."
"I was so nervous to meet you today."
"Britney Spears."
"I’m a big fan. I’m a big fan."
"Probably Three Doors Down, Lamar, and now Lamar Woods, and now Lamar woods."
"Now I want to kind of give you a different song oh, I got some other songs. I didn’t know you’re gonna play it real time I got to talk about it."
"That’s how interviews work. You’re supposed to play a song, I bought my head okay. Like, I know, I have any rhythm. We’re kind of quiet, we’re vibing we’re feeling it."
"The truck cuts. And then it goes to the first question. And my first question could be something, you know, just like an icebreaker. You know, right. I was thinking your album is titled Highly Sensitive Person, now, sometimes, a title says it all. So is it true? Are you an HSP? We sort of discussed this up at the top. So now I kind of have more of an answer before I met you but let’s talk about that."
"I mean, you could probably tell immediately, but yeah, I at first, I really did just think it was a cool album title, because I liked I liked the word highly. And I like when people put highly in front of things, like highly favored or like, highly empowered. So I was like, oh, just gonna be dumb, highly sensitive, and I figured out what sensitive. But then I was like doing the album. And I was like, it’d be something I have to talk about on podcasts, like Add To Cart. And I was like, maybe I should actually take the test and see if this is a real thing for me. And this is this is last year, and I took the test and the test was like, if you answered more than 14 of these questions yes, then you’re highly sensitive. And I answered 24 yes."
"24 to 24."
"Yeah, I was like I like aced it. And then okay, I just real quick, I just said I know this song I want to replace one of the songs is we’re talking about how."
"No, you’re not allowed. You’re not allowed to what […] you think about? Well, I don’t know, you think you think about the that you’re thinking? And we’ll end the episode with that song."
"Okay, okay. I just gave you like, the songs I gave you were more like, what I would call the singles, you know, but I was like, if we’re getting deep, I was like, oh, let’s get into these album cuts, okay, anyway."
"You let the aunties tell you what you should you’re okay […] With your pretty eyes, tell me where to let me tell you where to sit."
"But I took that test and I started crying because some of the questions were so specific, like, like stuff that I was never, you know, obviously, I always thought it was a sensitive person. But like, there’s things that I’m like, oh, yeah, I don’t like watching violence on movies and movies that I was like, yeah, I thought that was just me, but it’s like a part of it, and I was like, crying because I was like, oh, this is me. And it made me it made me rethink everything. Like I had to read this. And then and then I really once I did that, I went back and did recorded another 10 songs. And just like, really, really explored the highly sensitive aspect in the album too. So except for the songs that you guys get."
"I love it, the title chose you. You know, it’s like the sword. You know what I mean?"
"Yeah, it changed my life, yeah."
"You’re known as a comedian. But this album, this isn’t a comedic album. This is an earnest hip hop record."
"Oh, yeah, this is this is real rap right here. This is hip hop for sure. Like I was a rapper for a long time in my 20s and then I just got into comedy and never got back to it and then we went on strike and I was like, I was like, I really want to have a rap album before I die you know just to exist you know? And so it’s very sincere but there is some funny like elements to it is some skits on it and there’s like, got like Mike Mitchell from the Doughboys is in one of his kids. So it’s and Tony Baker a stand up comedian. So there’s an element of my comedy world in the album which I don’t want to hide from but it’s that that was not fun, it’s not like we’re now yanking pitches."
"Well, let’s listen to some songs. Are you both ready?"
"Alright, do it like MTV? Like like got it you do the MTV thing like they like hey, what’s up and we we got this spring is spring break."
"New mix. I’m […] leave the girl alone. Yeah, my […] pistol in the drawers and the Buddha on the shelf. A little Prozac just for my mental health. Marty McFly Nagel back from the future, hands holding hands girl don’t let me lose you. This is my life and I ain’t looking back. Batty on the best, but yet as looking fat. I’m on my second wind yet is zero cooking crack. Music is my best friend, I make a lot of rap, let’s go. Therapy, smoke […] we went up Phil panic, and I gotta breathe. Trying to satisfy nigga needs. Yeah, gotta satisfy nigga needs."
"Wan’t sensitive. You talked about therapy, okay literally in."
"this, But I also talked about stealing someone’s girl."
"We contain multitude."
"Sensitive people can do that, in fact I would argue that’s a secret superpower."
"To a lot of sensitive guys."
"That’s very true. That’s all works. Okay yeah, I’ve done a front porch and those songs are great actually, it sounded really good in my headphones, so I’m glad that was one of the songs. I was like this should tell you."
"Okay, let’s listen next to one that got away."
"If I was in Atlanta, I’ll probably be married by now. If I was in Atlanta, then I’ll probably be married by now. She the one that got away. I don’t know what else to say, say, she the one that got away. I don’t know what else to say mama saw them women on my shed baby fine baby fit and Yukon and you reg tight like Lilo and some Stitch. This house is big. I can fuck you in a […] I’m from LA. but um, but that took the train to Georgia. I met this girl named."
"Oh my god, if reading your auntie."
"I was like, I don’t want to play this way, that’s what I didn’t want to play. Like, it’s hot there’s a family moment. And that’s like literally the one song that’s like that vulgar. Like, pretty much most of the songs are very sensitive. But hey, look, I’m from Atlanta, I had to do it, yeah. There’s a running theme in the album about an inability to commit, you know, so I think even though that song is like, was kind of like, oh, I think this would be fun to have like an, like a club banger, or whatever. The song is kind of about me like being single for a very long time. And like, I’d really feel like I blame la for that, and I think I think if I’d never left LA, I think I’d be married and by now, literally, was Atlanta, I’ll be married but if you know."
"If you never left Atlanta, you would be married by now."
"That’s what I’d say yeah. I feel like I’m having a hard time dating in the city but I think Atlanta is like, not that there’s something special about Atlanta. I think it’s more than LA is hard to date here. So that’s that so even in that song, there’s still an element of like an emotional thing I’m struggling with."
"I think LA is the hardest city in the world to date. I like can’t think of another city that I’ve either been to or theoretically know about. That has the confluence of how sprawling it is to you know that we’re all in our cars all the time to that it’s a one in town. It’s lonely, I mean, there’s so many aspects to LA that I just don’t understand how people date in LA."
"Yeah, I really feel like the times when I had the most success in LA it was usually somebody who was from here who like grew up here. I think there’s something about people being not having roots in a city where I’m like, oh, you were dating each other you have your family’s not here, not here. My family’s not here. I think it’s hard to like build a relationship sometimes where you’re like we are each other’s only really foundation and it’s sometimes it feels like it feels like people just kind of bail on it and also just too many people I think a lot of it is just like a numbers thing where like I think everyone knows that if they it doesn’t work out there’s there’s enough people here today someone else and and then it ends up people end up like just moving on quicker. But so that’s what that song is about. If I was in Atlanta be married by now."
"Lamar, let’s transition into your cart. But first we want to know what type of shopper are you? What’s your style?"
"I shop online a lot and I usually do the best sight ASOS and I’m like buying clothes on there but recently I was working on a pilot like as my luxury fashion I realized I didn’t know what I was talking about. I had to get into it and I started going to the mall like old school like the Beverly Center. I want to go in those stores where it’s like security like you have to like go wait in line and go in and I got addicted to it so that’s like to your auntie so now I, that’s how I shop now like only in luxury stuff."
"I did not that left turn. I’m sorry. You went from shopping online at ASOS to security guards?"
"Well because now I like it. […] yeah, I when I shop now I don’t go shopping a lot like and I I guess I’m really talking about clothing right now. But if we’re talking about other stuff, if it’s like outside of clothing, it’s just usually like in my neighborhood like local shopping or whatever. But as far as like clothing, which is my favorite thing to shop for or I am like fully going back to like old school Rick and Morty like in the store trying shit on because I usually don’t buy a lot of things at once I like like when I had I had a show last week. I bought the outfit like the day of and I went so I went to like I think it was Prada, when they’re saying I’m over here flex shouldn’t be flexing."
"Shows about baby."
"You’re not going to be single at the end of this episode, let me tell you."
"I’m not gonna buy prada, like I can’t do I so."
"That’s good that you say that, Su, it’s good that he makes that disclaimer."
"It’s only for me."
"No, there’s a lot of wonderful ladies who who really appreciate a man who knows what’s going on, know it’s about qualities."
"And appreciation for the finest thing."
"Yeah, that can bleed into other areas of that relationship. All I’m saying."
"TThat’s very true. What I like about it is like I’m just really big on cuz I used to be a manager at a wax museum isn’t that related at all but customer service is like use to me. So I like to experience. Timeout."
"Wax museum or customer service? I’m curious because I’m sitting straight up for both."
"You mean Madame Tussauds Wax Museum?"
"The one and only, to South Hollywood I was running that place I was the man out there you know saying they call me Mr. Wax. I used to walk in with a briefcase in his suit. It can be big wax out there. I was wax, I was wax tested. I was I was waxing on not all babies."
"That’s right and you watch it on about customers service."
"The lines are going dead. We got to drop in the lines."
"We’re dropping the lines and we’re trying to drop the panties alright let’s move away from customers service."
"Let’s move away from from Mr. Wax customer service."
"Let’s get away, let’s get into your cart. I think this is going to bring us back because Lamar is adding to cart any kind of spa treatments."
"Yes, yeah."
"Let’s dive. What do you mean by that?"
"Yeah, I’m new to this so this so you guys can help me if you enter spas and stuff. So I got into this over the pandemic because I was like I just had a lot of background and so I was I went to the spa I went to get a massage and at Four Seasons in Beverly Hills it was just blew me away. I’ll tell you that."
"That lives are lighting up live callers are all gonna."
"Wax man is who I have though, you know saying if you if you can’t if you can’t love me as a wax on the first day."
"That layer must be revealed to only the sacred ones. You know what I mean? Like we, that’s worse people are going to love you for the wax man. But that’s live here in a little bit of Prada and four seasons massages go on."
"So yeah, four seasons, I will go there in the afternoon, it was a beautiful thing so I’ll go get the massage and I it was my first I mean my first time I just was blown away and the girl who did she’s like she’s the one who teaches everyone else I just got lucky that I got like the main person. And I was it was just like amazing. So then I go into the the sauna and steam room all that for me, you know, black dude from Atlanta like this just wasn’t a thing I was exposed to so yeah, I feel it feels like obvious in some on some level but also it’s like no, I just never done this before. So that was like you know 2020, and then now I’m like now I’m just I’m hitting up different spots I’m up at Raven spa, Raven spa got oh, they got you know they got you feel like you outside but you inside as well. And in terms of like products I haven’t that’s where I’m moved, that’s why I was asking you on another podcast collab about face, like face moisturizer, skincare and stuff but I think anything in that world I’m fascinated by and I’m trying to get better at it, as I started doing. I want to start to get more into pedicures manicures anything like self care related. I’m into that stuff, yeah, that’s why."
"I ap[plaud you. I mean to kind of tag on that. You’re also adding to cart quality tequila. With that, well tequila at the bar."
"Yeah, take us on this journey. Where did you start and where are we today on this tequila?"
"Okay, it’s all started, you know, it always starts with, they may be out some rappers shit in Atlanta’s like patrolling or whatever, you don’t know what the hell’s going on. And then I’m like a kid then it was like, oh casamigos is the shit. Like Castlevania has like a tense so much additives to it and like sugar and stuff. And this was this this came about because I was like, I couldn’t figure out a drink, like, maybe I should just not drink the older I get, you know, I’m in my late 30s now, and I was like, I’m just like, not recovering well, and I’m like, I’m like, what is my drink and be like, I just want what like, how about James Bond has his one drink martini or whatever. I just want like a drink that I get when I go out, that’s not gonna fuck me up. And it ended up being tequila. So now but then I was like doing Casamigos and I was still feeling sick or not sick but just like hungover and I was like, oh, just sugar in there. So then now we’re at the where I’m at now is Don Julio is pretty good, every bar kind of has that. Then we got Fortaleza, which is amazing. And this one called Ojo, Tequila Ojo, which is my favorite tequila of all time, I love that, I love that one it’s so smooth and I just yeah, just drink either neat or with a big rock, if they have the big rock. Some places they’ll be having a big rock, I like to big rock. I don’t like a lot of little rock because."
"Ice, without that craft ice, it’s gonna dilute your […] chill."
"It wet."
"Water down, you’re not gonna get the properties of the Ojo."
"It goes from Ojo to uno, a wave of like it’s it’s all stuff. I don’t tell people I like because also not working right now. So I shouldn’t be doing any of this. But going back to highly sensitive thing. I really just don’t like ice and my drink like a little a lot of ice because it’s my teeth, it makes my mouth sensitive. I don’t like the way it feels like, like I have to drink with a straw. I think that’s the HSP me, or do you feel that way to do like, drinking from cups with a bunch of?"
"No, I’m not, it’s clumsy."
"You don’t like it?"
"Wow."
"Look."
"Yeah, all the ice comes history of the gum, your gums and stuff. I don’t like that unless it’s a big rock."
"It’s unpredictable. I’m there with you. I’d also teeth. Teeth are important as we get older, again, we’re dropping the lines. Now I’m just cooling off all the live. As you get older, you got to protect your teeth. And so yeah, every dentist will tell you drink with a straw."
"Oh, really? All right so now I don’t feel as bad because I always I feel like they always look at me funny when I ask first because it seems like I mean, I get that not in the environment says but it just I think it’s like a masculinity thing going on where they’re like, I’m like gonna have a straw please, and they always look at me like, why?"
"Well, that, well, I think we need to I mean, I think we need to put this on the list for therapy. Let’s put the straw let’s put it on, and maybe it’s later, maybe top of my list."
"Same for me. What’s your drink of choice, Ku?"
"Because I’ll be at a bar with the homies like, like Carl and all my homies and they all they all drink and they drink straight from the glass. And then I’m over here and like sipping on the straw. And I’m like, I’m just trying to protect my teeth right here. Okay, so there’s one more tequila really just discovered that I’m liking now. Oh class, this class Class A class, but that that’s one I love I dragged that on my album release party. I just drank that whole I drink that whole bottle which is crazy. And I felt nothing. I woke up great, which is not normal for me so I was like, it does seem like the higher quality tequila, the better for my body it is or whatever I’m responding to it better."
"I do like the tequila and also to kilo plus a little bit of mushroom chocolate. And that’ll take me in the perfect party mood. And I will not be hungover the next day."
"That sounds really fun. A little mushroom and."
"It’s a little bit a little mushroom instant tequila, little umami with my Agave."
"What is that personality? I’m just curious that comes out. I love it. Love more I don’t drink and so often which is a shame people don’t drink around me. I prefer it when people are drunk around me. It’s much more fun for me. But I don’t get to see everybody’s you know what I mean? Agave mushroom personalities as much so who what what’s what’s your personality?"
"Yeah, so this is going to fuel going to the club. That’s me and that’s what is being asked of me because I normally go to bed and try to be in bed by 11 but that’s not what’s gonna happen and Minami for Miami Beach pride. So when I’m being called to do for the people is to give life of the part, to give classy ratchet that deteriorates. Yes ratchet, and that slides down, but everybody knows it’s gonna happen. And we’re all like we’re just waiting for the inevitable but we need to be at a high frequency to."
"Stop man we’re so similar, I that’s exactly how I would I am yeah."
"Yeah, Lamar would what’s your, what’s your."
"Exactly Kulap, like I go I start really like clap oh you said classy,"
"Classy ratchet, you know."
"Classy ratchet. I’m like, yo, let’s get the Viet let’s get the booth. Let’s you know let’s let’s get settled down. Everyone makes sure they even a glass of wine to start maybe like a glass of champagne to start off, and then we hit the tequila. And then by the end of the night, I’m just like, I got my shirt off."
"Bottoms off, shirts off."
"Yeah, we poppin bottles. I’m using I’m also the person who’s buying ship for everyone like stranger like yo, yo, I want to drink I want to take a shot, I’m just like doing that, and then it’s just like a completely different person. I wonder if our rachet is looking like, like my ratchet looks like, I’m trying to think of an Atlanta rapper. But yeah, like, like Jermaine Dupri or something. That’s like, that’s what I’ve been covering oh, I feel like."
"I think they would go well together. If not the same, I feel like they would run they would it would be like, yeah, there would be cousins, they would think it would be in the same VIP. We would be like, you know, it’s not just about us. It’s about everybody’s experience. I believe that as well."
"Yeah, I bet, it’s like we’re it’s like I’m not having a good time, unless everyone is having a good time. You know, it’s like, it’s kind of like my Luther King said, you know, we’re not we can’t survive, if it’s just us. It has to be everybody. We have to have justice for everyone."
"And that is why we still honor the great king."
"Yeah."
"You know."
"If I’m gonna turn up if I’m turning up with some shots, I want everyone at the bars right this shots. All right, I’m silly today sorry, yeah."
"No, no apologies."
"I love being your crack human. Can I always be your first human of the day is amazing."
"I just imagine that you have this cat. You have a cat spray, just like put it in the cart, like I that’s how I imagine."
"Look, Tiffany, can we cut that as a clip from now on that we would Lamar’s voice saying put it in the cart."
"Here we gotta get it clean, are you ready?"
"Okay, go."
"Put it in the cart."
"Let’s talk about things you’re removing from carts."
"Oh, yeah cool."
"And I want to know, why are you removing? We chopped specifically, overcomplicated?"
"What is that?"
"Oh, I don’t like okay, there’s two way shots by my house. The one I used to go is just like a kind of a hole in the wall like low key spot. You just go get the weed and get out of there. And like there’s one by my house called the set, right? And it’s like, it’s like so over the top. Like, it’s like it wants you to be like, like, you feel like you’re in a movie set. And then like you go in and it’s like and like, yeah."
"Wow, I didn’t know that this exists the set, I now I get it."
"Yeah, it’s becoming like, it’s just not fun to buy weed this way, that’s not really on game. Fully to like, like the like, at the end. When you go to the register it says you’re all set. Like it shouldn’t say like, that’s a wrap."
"Yeah, one metaphor. You there metaphors and it’s."
"Yeah, cuz then what does anything mean, you know, exactly. Set match point."
"It doesn’t make the shopping experience better, it just feels like almost like."
"It’s confusing a little, and makes you scratch your head."
"And then you don’t know where anything is. And it’s just big, I’d rather just go to one where it’s like just helped me get the weed and and get out of there you know, I mean, like, I don’t want to spend a lot of time here. It doesn’t really the people who are creating it, smoke weed. Like, it feels like removed from the experience of smoking weed. It doesn’t feel like they’re like connecting to the soul of the weed head you know, so, but that’s a very."
"That’s an HS POV […]"
"I like that. That’s an HSP POV."
"And there’s always an HSP POV to everything in life, right?"
"My typical."
"Wow, wait Lamarr is this you know, like social media bit and said like Bill Maher’s new rules, you’re like […]"
"Yeah, that’s an HSP POV no ice, no ice to drink. Straws only HSP POV I need that thick. I didn’t, I didn’t fit candles not the long candles HSP POV."
"Taper freak me."
"I need clothing that I need any clothing that fits me HSP all right, but honestly, I joined Tik Tok a couple weeks ago, and I have no content so this might be perfect for that."
"Anything this appearance has been a real workout for us all."
"Yeah, I love that and that helped promote the album was great. Yesterday, my manager I think."
"Oh Su."
"I mean, I think all I have no idea why I only yes, exactly. I just want to be your your auntie and the first human, I have no interest in managing anything other than everything."
"Yeah, we just want to give our opinions with this the sort of the freedom of not having really any continence."
"Or factual evidence backing up."
"No, there’s like, it’s like, no follow up it is it’s."
"No zero."
"After we hit me up is like you should take this vitamin, but then, you know, she’ll never follow up to see if I actually."
"We have it’s on the call only goes one way. You know, we have very specific specific communication devices goes out outgoing calls only."
"Before we let you leave, you are also removing from cart air, is it Airbnbs or Airbnbs? Or Airbnbs?"
"Airbnbs my favorite topic go."
"I just don’t like them anymore. They I feel like something happened. Whatever the whatever this sort of, like cache nature I had when we when they first started and was cool. That’s just gone now, it’s just like I’m in someone’s house. It just feels weird, and then also, I feel like a lot of Airbnbs and maybe I’m a part of the problem here, because I’m just a people pleaser, and I always get five stars, but like, I feel like they get really aggressive after you stay there like please review like they’re like, and like let’s say it was fine, like it wasn’t amazing, everything, it was just a fine thing. But then they’re hitting me up like you got to review he got to review a key please, and then I just like end up giving him five stars, and I think everyone’s doing that and now like the rating system is kind of not working as well because you’re like, oh, I go to I cuz I always look at reviews before I go. And they’re just never good, the never as good as as it’s saying online, I think is in conjunction with me re falling in love with hotels again. And like cool like artsy hotels like the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs, that’s my favorite. The lines getting back up and my hair and alive, the other girls call it. All right, I’ll tell you if I was Atlanta, I’d be married by now. But y’all feel me on Airbnb thing, like I think."
"100%"
"I feel more bad than the weed thing, yeah."
"I think to, it goes back to your thing about customer service. And and you get to a certain point in life where you’re just priorities change you know, like, I think when you’re younger and you’re doing an Airbnb to save money, I get it. You know what I mean? Like, there’s a lot of reasons that that works or you get to a certain point you have, maybe you have kids that you have to take care of all of these things, and suddenly, your priorities are different. You need customer service. I have had such horror stories with Airbnb, especially with kids, they have zero customer service. In the end, you really don’t have that much recourse when you walk into a place and you’re like, oh, no, this is this is a crime scene. I can’t see here, and I’ve just got off a flight, it’s 2am, where the hell am I supposed to go?"
"I’m not making this up, there was an entire family living under the house like, like, it was like I rent this Airbnb in Malibu. I walk I don’t know, what was it, like, maybe it gave me chills like because I walked out. It was a very beautiful house because on the cliff in the hills and in Malibu, I walked down because I wanted to hike and go see the nature and stuff. And I look over and there’s just a guy with his shirt off like eating soup on the porch. And I’m like, who the fuck is that? Like? So then I hit up the ladies, I’m like, who is that? And she’s like, they take care of the grounds or whatever. And I’m like, no, this it was like a full last family. Like this was not they were not working, it was like it was like it was like a father a son, and then we can hear them arguing in the middle of the night, they were like fighting with each other. I mean, they didn’t come into the house, but they definitely were like, like, you know, living like like habitat."
"No, and that’s not what you want when you’re on vacation."
"You’re working […]"
"It was crazy."

"Okay, let’s play a song called thinking about you so it’s a little more sensitive."
"Lines are lining up Lamar, lines are lining up."
"Yeah, let’s go I ain’t afraid of commitment I just don’t like to set up. I’m an open book ask me anything but don’t metal. My brains like wind chimes always talking never said oh yeah, I’ll put you in that house at Gucci like you Jared Leto. Miss your style miss your humor Michelle Alex."
