"Hi everybody, it’s your old pal Sarah. I was in the past few months has been a lot of press, a lot of gowns, a lot of things. And I was in a gown. So ridiculous. And I had to wear Spanx under it, not for shapewear reasons. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. But I had to because of thyroid because it was a tight dress. And when I can’t wear a tight, you know, skirt without like, shorts or something because I get thigh rub and it’s real. It like burns like fire. So I was wearing these Spanx, and then they to pee. There’s a slit in the Spanx that up through a hole, right. And I just thought it would be interesting to mention, because when you’re doing it, so I’m like basically holding a gown in my arms. And now kind of have to move it to one arm, like hold everything. And then open up this p whole envelope thing at my crotch. And then I have to have a conversation with myself. Because it feels like you’re peeing with pants on. And your body’s like, no. And I’m like, no trust me. And my body’s like, no there’s pants on. And I go, no, just relax trust me, there’s an opening. And I have to relax and I have to coax my urine out. That’s a lot going on."
I have a question. ask you about that.
"Okay, go on."
"When you because I’ve never been able to do that. Like, I feel like it still gets everywhere. Like, did you have a clean pee?"
"Shockingly, I did because usually my pee comes from I don’t know exactly where but I know at least three to four different places."
Because my fear with that is like up and then like you’re just sitting with a wet crotch the rest of the night.
"Yeah, like sometimes I pee one solid stream. And sometimes it’s like, sprinklers. It’s literally like, am I watering grass in a nearby area? Totally like, yeah. I mean, does that mean there’s because usually if you turn on your faucet and it goes different places, there’s like a clog somewhere that’s like pushing it. So is there a clog in my urethra?"
"Well, I’m sure this is a clinical reason, but it’s probably because your labia is like stuck together and it’s just bouncing."
"Oh my god, wait. So if I pull open, my vulva, my labia majora, open that’s the sound it makes. It should be a single stream. But uh, you know if you’re I know what you mean when your lips are kind of sealed from like this. Like the I can picture like pee coming in almost like going straight to the back before like opening up. She’s dying. We have fun here at the Sarah Silverman podcast."
The moral is it’s so much easier to pee when you’re a man it is period.
"And you know, I remember years ago, I bought something online that was that you could stand up and pee for women. It was like, like a cup that you put over your vulva and then it comes out like basically like a makeshift penis. And you can stand in pee, and I used it, I remember I was at Jessica’s friend’s house. We were watching the oddly like the man show, season something Premiere or whatever. I don’t know why I remember that. And I go, oh, I’m gonna use my standing pee thing. And I used it, and it worked. But it made me feel so weird. Like I was just by myself, you know, maybe just gotta look to little."
Is it like a funnel?
"It’s like a funnel basically, it’s a funnel. And you’d think oh, great. Gonna have it in cars gonna have it. I’m gonna have it for you know, whatever, it’s like if you go to a concert if you go to, because guys don’t realize like when you have to sit, and you’re like, it’s fun to go to a dingy dive bar until you’re a woman and you have to pee. It’s like a whole process."
I’m a two seat cover kind of girl over here.
"Needless to say, we I think even the audience knows this."
"Which is why, Chicago O’Hare Airport is the best place so good to be."
"That’s the one where you press the button and it it’s a brand new like, covered in a bag."
Yes.
It’s why don’t they do that everywhere? Why is it every airport this way?
But then I also know they say like seat seats are like the cleanest?
"Yes, the seats I sit down like I just sat down on the seat here, it’s immaculate."
"Yeah, that’s not ever gonna be me."
"Yeah, I know. But like tushy cheeks aren’t dirty."
"I know, but that’s that’s yours. I mean, we could probably make an argument that tushy cheeks are incredibly dirty, depending on how well someone’s wiping."
"Oh, god, yeah, if you shit it on your ass cheeks, your there’s you’ve got more problems. I’m guessing, there’s no way your only problem in life is you smear shit on your ass cheeks when you wipe God. Anyway, let’s take some calls."
"Hi, Sarah, this is Kelly and I was hoping to ask you your opinion on long term goals. I am a small business owner, 44 years old. And I wanted to know how you approach long term goals. Because to me, they’re kind of moot because we’re not in control of everything so I look to the future. I know, like by 64, I would want to sell my business or retire. It’s like 20 years. But then I think about like all the stuff that can happen and 20 years, especially with how unstable everything is right now. So I struggle with developing those long term goals. And then I even struggle with the short term goals to get me to that long term goal, if that makes any sense. Yeah, I just wanted to get your opinion on that. And see how you as a business owner and media personality and fantastic person all around if you have any advice for that, because you have great advice, and thank you so much for all your wonderful entertaining, comedy and advice. It is something that I look forward to every Thursday morning when I’m walking my dog, Biscuit. So thanks so much, and hope to hear from you soon."
"Hi Biscuit, you gonna walk? You gonna walk? Hey, biscuit. I just want you to play that for Biscuit. I wouldn’t say I’m goalless. But I always struggle with this because they never think about like, I want to do this in the next five years or I want to […] but I mean, I think because I’ve really come to a place where I fully understand and accept that I’ve never been able to predict the future and will never be able to predict the future so that helps me with anxiety, you know, just not trying to predict the future not trying to worry, tell myself horror stories about how that’s going to unfold because we just never know, we’ve never been able to know, you’ve never been able to predict anything your life. And neither have I. But in terms of long term goals, I mean things that I’ve said to friends, you know, who asked, I would say, make a plan, like you have 20 more years of your business and then retire, you’re making a long term goal. And then you follow that plan, follow that plan until it no longer serves you if you know there’s gonna, it’s either going to, you’re going to see it through through fruition and everything will go as planned, and more likely other things will happen, life will happen that will take you in a different direction and you’ll make a new plan. You know, I mean, goals are great, but it’s of course the road getting to those goals, that is the stuff of life, you have to hopefully enjoy that stuff. You know, because the goal either comes or doesn’t, you know, but the road get going there should be your joy, you know, obviously, like, maybe your joy isn’t working at all, you know, is not having a job or not having a business but you need to, you know, also being responsible for your happiness includes, you know, taking care of yourself financially so obviously it’s a mix of all those things. But um, you know, you got a long term goal. You have a plan to get there and follow that plan unless and until it doesn’t serve you anymore and then you make a new one. I don’t know what else? What other advice I can give along that but it sounds like you’re you’re doing great. But you know, I mean, not fulfilling a goal isn’t necessarily failure and failure isn’t even necessarily bad. So control what you can control and be on the edge of your seat for the rest of it. Good luck, what else?"
"I Sarah, what would be your favorite deep cut of yours? Like someone a fan passes you on the street? And they say, oh my god, I loved you in what’s the thing someone could say they saw and loved you and or like heard you in or knew that you were involved with that would make you most jazzed about that fun interaction?"
"Well, it’s, you know, again, I like that I do odd jobs, and it’s just funny. The way people know me like there are certain people that know me from Star Trek Voyager. And then there are people that only know me from Howard Stern. And then there are people that know me from like, Monk. And then there are people that are like, I was at Canter’s the other day, and the waitress goes, and I counters it’s like, I love counters all the waitresses are like, waitress all the servers sorry, are like 78 you know? But she goes, are you who you are? Are you who I think you are? And I go I maybe she goes, where are you the one from Marry Me? I was like, oh, yeah, I was in that movie. I guess I was like a friend and then movie. There are also people who know me, there are people just know me from stand up. So they just go oh, she’s really dirty, or she’s really blue. And then there’s people who know me, like I said from like, Monk, and they go, Oh, this is the one from Monk will go see her live and then they’re horrified. You know, there’s also people who who will reference. This is a deep cut is the way of the gun, which is a movie that I’m in just the first scene before the credits. And my character’s name, which I didn’t know until I saw it. And they it says just as raving bitch. But I get beat up by a lovely Ryan Philippi. And it’s a really dark, great movie. I think it’s Christopher McQuarrie, his first movie that he directed, but um, that was one of the three times I was punched in the face, because the other ones were more on purpose. But Ryan beats me up and we of course, you know, practice and we’re taught how to do it and everything. And I know, this sounds like a you know, I don’t mean to blame myself, but I think I’m I maybe I leaned in or something, whatever. But he fully connected, knocked to me off my feet. By the time I opened my eyes, I probably would have cried. But um, he was already crying. I think I’ve already told the story. So I was immediately like, it’s okay. He felt awful but it was cool. I had a huge like black and blue egg on my jaw. And that I believe that was the tape they used. And if not, they actually use the sound from it cracking my job because you can hear it. But that’s a good one. That’s a deep cut for sure."
"Hi, Sarah, my name is Emily. I nine years old. And I really want to be an actor. My mom doesn’t know if he wants me to do it. Because he said actor kids are spoiled brats. My question is, do you ever work with kids? And it’s my mom, right?"
"Oh, this is so hard. I don’t know how to answer this Emily because I was you at your age. Oh, I just wanted to be an actor, I wanted to be an actress, I wanted to be musicals, I wanted to be all these things. And I was so mad at my mom. She only let me be in school plays but you know what I was in school plays and it panned out great. I’m reading a diary entry. I kept a diary a meticulous diary. But like when I was like 12 and 13 so it’s not like the deepest shit but it’s you know, and one is like, mom will let me sign up for […] on which was like child models or whatever, just pay this, you know fee and we’ll get you or kids into modeling or whatever and of course, my mom was like, That’s bullshit, and you’re not doing it no. I wrote my diary because I knew someone would read it someday and know how abusive she was. Mom won’t let me do […] on. But um, you know, I did school plays, and it was awesome. And I was so into it, and I took an acting class. And there’s lots of stuff you can do at 9 and 10 and 11. You know, you could do that local plays, community theater, school plays. And I think your mom’s probably right in it seems like, for ever from now, before you are, you know, 18 and can make your own decisions or whatever it is, childhood takes forever, because, like, the first seven years of your life is your whole life. But like, to me seven years ago was like, oh, yeah, seven years ago, it was like, I was a comedian, I was doing that, you know, it was like, nothing ago. As you get older, life gets shorter. So I understand like, it feels like forever. But, you know, you know what I would do? I would be in my room and I would read monologues and I would, you know, I would do Emily, not you, but Emily, the character Emily and in our town, and she has a big monologue in the third act, and I would read it in my room, and I would, you know, I’d make stuff up with my friends. And you don’t have to be an earner, you don’t have to be making a living at nine. And you know, one thing I do disagree with your mom, is that these kids are spoiled brats. They might seem like spoiled brats, they’re children, working, like working a job like adults. It’s long hours, it seems very glamorous and fun. And because the only part that you see is the fun part. But it’s long and boring. And you’re not with your friends. And some kids thrive. Some kids thrive and then hit a real hard wall. You know, you’ll be right for and to answer your question. I do work with kids and I have worked with kids and I’m working with kids on this musical the bed wetter because it stars a 10 year old me. And boy, the rejection these kids go through is on another level. And a lot of kids it affects them in a negative way. Some kids thrive and you know, a they grow up to be Jodie Foster, they grew up to be Ron Howard or they grew up to be Selena Gomez. But um, a lot really don’t make it out well, you know, and to have like a real childhood to base the rest of your acting career on to actually have lived experience that isn’t on a film set or a TV set. You don’t want to hear it now and it doesn’t seem real now but they promise it will be worth it. God I couldn’t wait. I could not wait to be an adult and get to be an actor. And even then you don’t necessarily get to be an actor. I got lucky I was a stand up I you know, but that said I will say there are these New York kids, you know, that are Broadway veterans and they you know, the young woman who played me in the Off Broadway Run, Zoe Glick was beyond brilliant. I mean, she was like a tiny Meryl Streep. She didn’t she wasn’t naturally like a little me. She built this character. from the inside out. I watched it happen. And it was mind blowing. This kid is going to be have whatever career she wants, but we couldn’t use her anymore. For the crime of growing, she’s like 14, 15 now. And it was heartbreaking. Because I would have had her forever if I could. But the part is for a little kid. And what happens is, she aged out. Now she’ll age into other roles. She’ll play teenagers and she’ll play you know, older kids. But I can’t imagine what that’s like to she carried this show, this musical. It was all on her shoulders and she was absolutely brilliant. Brilliant and she grew out of it. She didn’t do anything wrong, she did everything right. I don’t know what the right thing is I, you know, I want to support you beat you. Listen, no one’s keeping you from being an artist. No one’s keeping you from performing monologues at dinner, or working on your craft or taking acting lessons or being in local plays. That’s what I did. And if you care about the craft, and it’s not just like, I want to be famous, which is not a craft, then you’ll love doing it. You know, doesn’t matter if the audience is five people or 5 million people. It’s about the craft of acting. And that’s what you are passionate about, right? There’s so much to learn. I mean, part of learning, acting is watching people, or, or listening into the table next to you at a restaurant or on the bus. You know, listening to conversations and thinking, this is real life. And as an actor, I want to capture what that is, I want to really be able to show what real life looks like you know, and study people and watch a million movies, and find out what kind of acting is interesting to you and watch different actors and how they play different roles. There’s so much to do in the next nine years for you to prepare yourself. Live life, observe people and have experiences, you know, if you can be in a local play or your school, play, do it all. But all of it feeds into your future. It’s all preparation. It’s all the stuff you draw on. You only have one childhood. Everything that’s happening right now in your life is the stuff you’re going to be drawing from as an actor. So you’ve already started, and your mom is probably doing the right thing. And I know you won’t understand it now. But you will, alright, what else?"
"Hey, Sarah, is your friend Mark, longtime fans love your comedy. I think we’re getting better every year. Please don’t ever stop."
"Thanks, Mark."
"Just listened to your recent podcast with the call from the listener who’s having trouble with gas as a result of a botched surgery some 47 years ago. And yeah, that’s a tricky one. But at the end of your little segment on this, you said I’m sure my listeners will be calling in and well, I’m one of them."
"Oh, good."
"I googled the problem and found a solution at least a partial solution. And that is a product called tootles TOOTLES thought it was a funny name. And I knew it would resonate with you […] it is underwear both for men and women that has a charcoal filter built into the back. I don’t think it’ll handle the noise aspect. But it should certainly address the smell. So if she could manage to adjust her rump in a way to minimize the vibration, then tootles should take care of the rest. I hope this helps love you."
"You know, I was sent a link to charcoal underwear by Jimmy Kimmel years ago and he’s like, dude, you should get this first of all, I don’t pass much gas and if I do, it never smells. If it does, it’s maybe because I’m like really sick or something like but it doesn’t, you know, but anyway, not that there’s anything wrong with that. But that was always like a thing with him and me he would anyway that’s ridiculous. I don’t do that. But um I so I am a little bit familiar with her charcoal underwear, it doesn’t muffle any sound. It’s just that the smelly air passes through it and the charcoal like cleans the smell or something. That’s not the technical answer, obviously. Anyway, thanks Mark, Tootles underwear. I don’t know if it’s, she didn’t mention it smelling but that’s definitely a good to know. All right, what else?"
"I Sarah, my name is John and I’m calling I just listened to your episode being girlfriend roof, roof feed, and I was very title running to the caller who was having what’s called fecal incontinence due to an accident and the seven days. It’s very common and it’s horrible that she has to think endure this alone, I too had the same problem due to radiation from lymphoma located in my lower region. I was put in touch with a colorectal doctor and he did something called a neuromodulation stimulator. And what it’s doing is it retrained, think of like those nerves, it’s the sacral nerve. And when the sacral nerve is damaged, think of it like a plant that is frozen at winter and it just dies back and when it gets to a certain level of dying back, it no longer works and you develop those type of symptoms. But the neuro modulator stimulator go stimulator is a surgically implanted device very similar to like a pacemaker for your heart. It’s a pacemaker for your poop, and it stimulates the sacral nerves, and I had 100% success with it and now I go about life not looking for a bathroom or."
"We should sacral nerves stimulator wonder if that’s covered by insurance, it certainly shouldn’t be for her. Sacral nerve stimulation is covered for the treatment of urinary urge incontinence urgency frequency syndrome and urinary retention. No but oh and fecal incontinence, incontinence? Is it covered by insurance? For ongoing therapy, the cost of the sacral nerve stimulation surgical implant was $22,970. Well, we should let her know about it. Maybe her insurance covers it. God, insurance, this whole racket of health care Gosh, darn it. I don’t want to get into it but anyway, thank you, John, for calling in. Let’s pass that information on. We have another one about this passing gas. Let’s see."
"Hey, Sarah, my name is Zoey. I first time caller. I just love and appreciate you so much. I have so many things to say. But specifically, I just listened to the episode about the lady who has you know, unintentional farts, and it sounds like."
Everyone’s way of describing it.
"And I guess I was thinking what she could say would be something like I have a medical problem, that’s likely to happen again. Because we’re human, it’s okay to laugh and say it in a serious way so it’s not like you’re really inviting laughter but just taking the forbidden aspect out of the laughter makes it actually live maybe less likely to happen. And just that we can all move on from that. I’m a nurse, I’m a hospice nurse. I just want to thank you so much from deep deep in my heart from for sharing your experiences with your the death of your dad and your stepmom there was so there was so much that so much I’m thankful for. And also last episode, I was, you talked about hearing loss. You talked about poor eyesight. I think you’ve met mentioned granny panties. There was some other very geriatric topic, and I’m I’m myself I’m 47 and I’m just so happy that to be you know, going through this time of life with you, thanks."
"I love that, it’s like it is true. It’s like we’re all like everyone in our age group is like going through it together, it’s like I remember hearing about like, Steve Martin and Martin Short and or like a bunch of comedians that all scheduled their colonoscopies like on the same day and then did prep together and played poker and just took turns like running to the bathroom together. And I just like it’s so there’s something very sweet about that."
"Hi, Sarah. I’m calling again from Barcelona. My name is Presley. Soy artista, and my previous question was about your famous dish that you would cook you may be featured in my cookbook, Sarah Silverman, very random great not special. My next question is I’m currently drawing a series based on Legendary establishments around the world. I was in LA over Christmas and I, I drew a few places for example, in of the sevens array, Casa Vega, El Compadre […] set Tower Hotel and I just wanted to know what is a legendary bar or restaurant to you? Where is the most legendary spot that I can draw in LA? Thanks a lot, bye."
"I mean LA is so many things, but for some reason I thought of Joan’s on Third just because I do think its aesthetic is so beautiful and I could see it drawn but Joan’s on Third is the restaurant on on third Street and it’s it’s just beautiful. It’s like there isn’t even a lot of can eat there but it’s so good. It’s just beautiful. It looks like it looks like the kitchen in every Nancy Meyers movie like I have to believe she bases her kitchens, her movie kitchens on Joan’s on Third there’s something about it, that’s like so reminds me of of any, any characters like gorgeous kitchen and a Nancy Meyers movie. Do you know what I mean? Amy?"
"Yeah, I love that idea. And I could add a few."
"Go on, yeah. Amy born and raised LA. So she would mean."
"You mentioned Cantor’s, which is obviously a staple."
"Can’t wait, did I mentioned Cantor’s?"
You mentioned in an answering another question when you said you were at Cantor.
"Oh, yeah, Canter’s, God."
"I would say any of the delis like a Nate now, a Canter’s. I also would say that LA Los Angeles is known for its Googy establishments, which is like a mid century kind of like the way that norms looks or those old diners."
And there’s Johnny’s that’s basically just for films.
"But there’s the one that’s over on the way to the airport. That’s a really cool one. And there’s quite a few diners that still exist, I would say the original Bob’s Big Boy, in Burbank."
"God, you’re killing this."
"Something to maybe look at. I mean, that’s just restaurants, and then in terms of bars, you know, some of the oldest bars are."
The Formosa?
"The Formosa or the Trocadero, which is like from the 20s. I would also argue like the Comedy Store, which is, you know, been around since the 20s, when it was cero or ciros. There’s a lot of like, historic stuff on Sunset Boulevard and old buildings that you if you drive by, you wouldn’t even notice that they were old, like like the gill Turner’s for example, that liquor store that’s like on the corner."
On Sunset?
"So I don’t know there’s quite a few cool places like old divey bars, like there was a place near where Kennedy, R F. Kennedy was shot. And it’s called the HMS bounty. It’s one of the oldest bars is kind of near Cape Town. It’s a really cool place, and then you know, there’s like Felipe downtown and there’s a lot of cool places downtown Langurs, I try to look at Langurs, too, which is an old school Deli."
"Oh my god, this is the best answer ever given on this podcast."
"Wow, thank you. I’m Angelina proud Angelina and a historic preservation Commissioner West Hollywood so."
That’s right.
Very invested in preserving old Hollywood.
"I love it. Yeah, there is so much even just like the Du-par’s at the grove. That old Farmers Market."
"Absolutely, Du-par’s,  is like a very untouched I mean, it’s still got those maroon booths. And and the farmers market itself is would be equally as good."
"Yeah, Bob’s donuts. Well, we we watched Bosch or I was away and Rory watched Bosch. I had watched it because I just like needed something to why it’s good. And dad’s love Bosch, but um, Rory, when he moved out here I was then on you know, working out of town for like three months and he watched Bosch and then like went to all the LA because it takes place in LA and he’ll be like, this was the best I went to so and so’s the hole in the wall where you get the best bagels in LA or whatever. And he would go to all of those like Bosch tour. All right, what else?"
"Hello, Sarah, my name is Yasmine, everyone calls me Yas. I work for a beauty company in Canada that’s also very popular in America. Black and white stripes if you get my drift. I don’t actually even know if I can legally say I worked there but whatever. You were talking about stamp eyeliner. The brand is called Kaja, KAJA, and they make this like really, really cute little Stampee. And you just do it a little corner of your eye and a little wing and it’s part Perfect and adorable and cute and it’s all one thing and it’s from a Korean company called Kaja. They also make really cute little blushes that are little compacts and bento box face products as well. They’re just adorable. So I hope that helps. Love you girl, you don’t even make up anyways, yeah."
"I wrap things. Yes, I think I saw that, or did you send that to me, it’s me. It’s like, it gives you the the cat I corner little triangle and then you fill in the rest. But the part that you fill in the rest is the part that I have the problem with, which is like staying on the line above my eyelid, you know, and like making a thick line."
"So usually, I mentioned that there was like a stamp when you mentioned it on the last show, but what you can do is just do like a dark shadow, so that it’s sort of a little smoky and then just use that stamp at the end."
"Oh, that’s what I started doing is I put like, I use like a dark shadow instead of a pencil and it’s just like you can mess it up a little more and then you just fix it with the Q tip."
"Victoria Beckham’s Kajal, her she has KAJAL liners. First of all her makeup is amazing."
It is?
"Oh my gosh, and it’s clean beauty and I the liners are insane. And she also has these cream shadows in a stick and there’s probably a like I use a dark brown but I was gonna actually suggest maybe there’s a darker one that you could use for this as well like what you’re looking for."
"Yeah, but you use the dark brown to line your lips don’t you know."
I use her dark brown on my under my eyes and over my eyes to kind of make my whole eye look reddish because I have green eyes and that purples and reds pops green.
What the fuck? How do you know these things?
I’ve been into makeup like my whole life. I’m good at doing makeup.
Well fun fact about Amy’s V is she uses a black eyeliner on her lips. And that’s her only lipstick.
But everybody that grew up in LA in the 90s did that. It just happened to stick with me.
I know it looks good.
But no one would ever know it was black. It just looks like I’ve got like a nice deep purple or something.
"Yeah, I would be I was shocked when you told me and showed me. All right, what else?"
"Hey, Sarah. It’s your best friend Amber calling from Sydney, Australia. This Saturday is the 46th annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in Sydney."
Wow.
"And to celebrate, I would just love to say to the world that I am completely and utterly gay. I’ve lived the majority of my life as a heterosexual woman. Then a few years ago, I got more comfortable with the identity of pansexual because I found that myself getting attracted to some women and some non binary people. And then last year in 2023, I finally got the flaps to take the leap and start dating women and I have to say that it has been the most beautiful and rewarding experience of my life. The depth of connection and the level of intimacy through dating women has just been like, offered studies. And so if there’s anyone out there listening who was like me and was terrified, just go for it. Find that person that you’re attracted to and just fucking go for it. What have you got to lose? Love you."
"Yes, Amber. Got a great call. Just a feel good call. And by the way flaps. That’s replacing lips for me. Get the flaps to do it, flaps I love that, that’s fucking great. Give it to the Australians with their they’re the best at the nicknames. Everything’s got a nickname. My sister in law Semaan. I carry this it was on this podcast that I think I made a joke about how they always have. We were laughed, she was laughing yet because I said they call the Holocaust the holy. But I made that up when I just said that they make nicknames out of everything. Was your family in the holly? All right, not funny. Funny? a little funny?
