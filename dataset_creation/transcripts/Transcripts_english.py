Awkward = """
Chloe  00:02

Myp ,a
Sy  00:03

I’m Sy.

Mariana  00:04

My name is Mariana.

Jeffrey  00:06

I’m Jeffrey.

Mariana  00:10

A few months ago, a documentary crew started following me and a few other trans friends around navigating everything from family, relationships, work, and more. There was always a story worth telling.

Jeffrey  00:27

And that’s what you’re about to hear. You witness moments alongside us, and you’ll get into our heads. On this episode, we follow Chloe.

Chloe  00:35

Because I have so little experience in the dating world for the most part, and I’m just open to all kinds of people.

Mariana  00:37

And we also follow Jeff.

Jeffrey  00:45

Oh my God, have you not seen that? Everybody’s getting married right now? This is BEING TRANS.

Chloe  01:13

Hey, how are you? My name is Chloe Corcoran. I am a 39-year-old trans woman from Rochester, New York working in higher education in Los Angeles, California.

Mariana  01:28

Oh my god, you play so nice. And you’re watching sport?

Chloe  01:35

I’m still relatively new to LA and Mariana, Who’s stopping by tonight is one of my first friends here. And she’s introduced me to some other trans people here through her meetup circle. And they’ve been really important in helping me acclimate to my new city. Oh my gosh, what is this

Mariana  01:52

makeup we can play with makeup?

Chloe  01:54

Oh my gosh, thank you so much. Oh my gosh, this is fun

Mariana  01:58

Like I’m seeing you right now. And I’m thinking like when we go out, maybe just a smoky eye. And maybe lips kind of like a nude but very like glossy.

Chloe  02:08

I haven’t done in class, and I haven’t done the wings either. But I’d like to try both.

Mariana  02:13

I have a dose and make you feel like so ready to go out? Like a superhero.

Chloe  02:18

Yeah. So how was your week?

Mariana  02:21

Last night we had this party. And I’m still recovering. I was still like, oh my god. It was fun. But it was a lot of love a lot […] A lot of good-looking guys around. Shirtless over there. Do you ever go out?

Chloe  02:39

I’ve gone out by myself a few times. Because I don’t know how many people here. So hoping to change that.

Mariana  02:45

Are you open to me like people?

Chloe  02:48

I am. I’m trying to meet people. I’m on a lot of dating apps and stuff like that. But I guess I grew up with like an idealized version of like, what dating would be like, but I didn’t date for so long. While I was not dating, people moved into like a swipe culture or things moving a lot more quickly than maybe I was prepared for or used to, especially, you know, when I was first transitioning, and things like that. So it’s been interesting to think about, but like, that would hit me hard. I was like, oh, the whole dating game has changed. I kind of missed out on it. Before I came out publicly, I didn’t really see a romantic future because I wasn’t being myself. And I wasn’t being true to myself. And I guess one of the reasons I ventured out to Los Angeles, is because I am hoping to date and find a partner. On the flip side, dating as a trans person has been incredibly difficult. I’ll match with people and then they’ll read my profile, and they’ll quickly unmatch. Or, like, I’ll be talking with someone like a guy or girl and I like trying to get together. I was like, hey, let’s meet up for a drink. They’re like, cool your place? And I’m like, no, I would rather like go out for a drink or coffee or something like that. Just to like get to know somebody a little bit.

Mariana  04:08

Yeah, I mean, dating is sometimes they’re very open about like, you know, dating trans people, and sometimes they don’t want other people to know.

Chloe  04:19

I struggle with that a lot. I really do. People get it on an intellectual level, like, okay, yes, trans people are real, their experiences are valid. And then it gets down to another level where people aren’t willing or ready to confront their attraction to trans people. And that’s part of what makes dating so hard.

Mariana  04:40

Yeah. Because all these murders and everything that happened, like many times they start dating and they hate the fact that they love or attracted to a trans person. I mean, like, I believe that being trans on these days is like people at least people know what’s going on. Like before you had to make this whole explanation about it. Now, I think people like are more aware. I think there’s more options out there.

Chloe  05:13

Dating as a trans person is hard. And another thing that’s layered on top of that, is that I’m still trying to figure out my sexuality, which I guess is kind of open ended, even though I never would have admitted that before transitioning. All of this is pretty intimidating. And I’m hoping that a city as progressive as Los Angeles is the right place to figure this out.

Mariana  05:38

I mean, I always think like, nobody’s gonna knock at your door and say, like, hey, can I take you out?

Chloe  05:44

That is yet to happen to me. That has yet to happen anyone I know.

Mariana  05:49

Yeah. You need to be out there. In that energy. Keep it open. That was me last night. I was pretty open.

Jeffrey  06:10

Hi, everyone. I’m Jeffrey. Thanks for coming out tonight. I’m transgender. That’s what I am. It means I was a girl and now I’m, I took some testosterone. And now I’m a child. This is Jeffrey. I’m on the road doing a string of shows on the college circuit. I’ve got four shows in 48 hours. And I’ve gotten what, two done now. And I have two more left. I’m gonna do like a little Q&A thing. If you can ask me a question that I’ve never heard yelled at me before. I’ll give you 100 bucks. Let’s start with you.

Speaker 3  06:58

Have you had any surgery?

Jeffrey  07:01

That’s an awesome question. I haven’t had top surgery. So I still have the boys. I call them the boys. Don’t gender my tits. What makes me different is that I have kind of a comedy Q&A where I challenged them to ask me questions about being trans. The students like it because they get to make the show whatever they want it to be. This week is definitely one of the busiest ones I’ve had in a while but at least college kids keep it interesting. What I’m gonna go to Mardi Gras. And I’m gonna flash dudes all fucking night. Because in my mind, a bunch of frat dudes waking up in the morning and being like, dude, were we that drunk? Or did that small boy child have really nice tips?

Jeffrey  08:23

I can hear you. Can you hear me? Me and my girlfriend Emma are navigating a long-distance relationship right now because she is currently studying to be a helicopter pilot. So living long distance is hard enough as it is. But then with touring and being on the road all the time. It’s hard to kind of match up schedules and just make time for each other. But I try to always catch her between gigs. Well, the show went really well tonight. Yeah, it was good. It was like actually a totally decent turnout for what it was. It was like 45 people. I went awesome. The people who booked me were like, super nice. I warned them that like hey, it might get awkward. And they were like we love awkward. So it was really fun. And now I’m navigating through the college town and all of its little roundabouts because it’s hip, and it’s a college town and they got roundabouts and trying to get back to the highway so that I can fly out in I don’t know what five hours maybe a two-hour drive back to the airport. I’ve got to drop the rental car off. And it’s not enough time even though they gave me a hotel room for tonight. I don’t have enough time to stay there. So instead I’m gonna go to the airport and I was going to try and like sleep there but this airport closes from like the life of a comic is, it’s insane. And while I know it, and I’ve done it a lot, it never really gets easier. Yeah, I do have to go find a place and fill up so they don’t charge me out the wazoo for gas at the rental car place. Alright, right. All right. well, I love you so much Baby Cakes.

Chloe  10:31

Okay, so this is recording. That’s good. This is Chloe. And I’m going to set my phone down here. I am putting on makeup. The makeup that Mariana gave me because I have a blind date tonight. One of my work colleagues set me up with someone she knows another trans woman named Eve. And that is literally all I know about her. So we’re going to head to a restaurant up the street. Of course, I want to smell good. A blind date. Honestly, it’s a bit intimidating. But I liked that we’re meeting in a more organic fashion, as opposed to being swiped right or left in most cases on an app. But I think it’s going to be good. I you know, I’m planning for the best. I’m hoping for the best. So wish me luck y’all. How are you today? I’m all set with water and just waiting for my date. Okay, thank you. How are you? I’m Chloe. Eve walks up. And sure enough, she’s gorgeous. Which makes me more nervous.

Eve  11:55

Yeah, just with a pumpkin harvest they call it.

Chloe  11:58

And I will do the Florida […]. How are you today?

Eve  12:04

Well, how you doing?

Chloe  12:05

Good. Did you find it okay?

Eve  12:07

Now I got here, right? I’m in South tel so not that far away.

Chloe  12:10

Oh, good. Good. Good. I’m just a few miles that way.

Eve 12:15

I still I don’t know the highways that well here yet.

Chloe  12:17

I know that 405 and 5 are big highways. But I don’t know where they go.

Eve  12:22

Yeah, I know where they go. I just don’t bother me. Yeah.

Chloe  12:27

Suppose we’d be a good pair, then. I know the names. You know where they go. Yeah, we’ll make it work. I’ll drive and you navigate. Thank you. How was your day?

Eve  12:44

Working. I work in entertainment. I have a really nice boss. She’s great.

Chloe  12:55

So I work for Emory University, which is in Atlanta. And I do their West Coast alumni relations. And I go to school.

Eve  13:04

What are you studying?

Chloe  13:05

I’m studying higher education leadership. Mainly, I just wanted to make my brother call me Doctor. And he says that he won’t, but if I get the degree kind of has to.

Eve  13:14

I guess I technically have a doctorate but not a doctor a doctorate. Say a law degree.

Chloe  13:19

What made you decide to go to law school?

Eve  13:22

Well, I originally wanted to do LGBTQ rights law. And so yeah, I went to law school at that mine. It was like, right after I came out. So I was just like, oh, I want to like help the community.

Chloe 13:38

I think a lot about whether it’d be ideal to end up with another trans woman, just because there’s so many shared experiences in an understanding of the things that we go through. That can be hard to explain to a sis person sometimes. Are you from LA?

Eve  13:56

No, I moved here from DC. Back in July, I grew up in Virginia. I don’t have any family there.

Chloe  14:06

My family’s all back in my hometown, like everyone which is Rochester, New York. I don’t know that any of my family has ever left, actually, I think I’m the first one. I’m really I think I’m the first queer one. And then I’m the first one to leave. I wonder if they’re related.

Eve  14:23

I am. I’m the first in a lot of ways for my family. I. Yeah. Well, I’m definitely the first one to come out here to the West Coast. And, like the first yeah, like the person in my family and first person going to college. My family. I don’t know what your family is like, but some of my family is like very Trump town. I don’t see much of my family. Yeah, I see my dad a little bit. And then my sister. I guess I’ll see her a little bit.

Chloe  14:53

My brother and I’ve come a long way. My dad is quite conservative and very Catholic.

Eve  15:00

My dad, I think had the hardest time. Although my dad’s come around, you know, it took him like a year or so. I generally don’t talk a lot about trans stuff.

Chloe  15:12

I don’t either a ton. You’re easy to talk to. Going into this, I was really nervous about how I’d even react. Would I be awkward? Because sometimes I default to that. So far, I think the dates going well, we again, have some shared experiences and some things to talk about and seems to be relatively easy. This was really fun.

Eve  15:45

Let’s exchange information. Well, here, I’ll get your phone number. I’ll text you and you’ll have my stuff. Okay, it was so nice to meet you.

Chloe  16:03

Thank you so much. Well, I’m looking forward to hanging out again.

Eve  16:07

Anyway, have a good night.

Chloe  16:17

So I think the day went, well, she’s a great person. I’m excited to see where this goes. And yeah, I was nervous. But now I’m really happy.

Theresa  16:26

I’m late. I was like, I’ve never driven in Los Angeles rain before. And apparently no one else.

Jeffrey  16:49

I’m back in LA. And my good friend Theresa’s coming over tonight. And I’m honestly exhausted from the last round of shows. But like really looking forward to seeing a familiar face.

Theresa  16:59

Although this is a random thing. But at some point tonight, if you want to go grab dessert, I’d be down and go grab like a slice of pie or something.

Jeffrey  17:06

Oh my god, that would be amazing. Theresa is the best. Because when I feel like I’m super overworked or busy, like I just remember she’s a doctor and like 18 other things. So she’s the person I can pitch to about how busy we both are. I got in at like 2AM last night from all those shows.

Theresa  17:27

Oh, well, what was it like on tour?

Jeffrey  17:30

I don’t know. It’s really rough. You go by yourself. You fly by yourself. You get a rental car by yourself, you know, the hotel by yourself. I think, I don’t know. Standup is great. I don’t feel like it’s a forever thing.

Theresa  17:48

Oh, wow. And how like, when do you think that switched you where you’re like, I don’t want to do this anymore.

Jeffrey  17:56

I think about six or seven years in is when I started to feel so lonely on the road. So my alcoholism got the worst of the worst.

Theresa  18:07

Well, you’re doing like I remember you told me you’re doing. You were traveling for weeks at a time, right?

Jeffrey  18:12

Oh my gosh, that’s the worst part of it. Being on the road is already crappy enough. You’re the only one to keep yourself accountable and sober when you’re traveling and on the road. But then add on that you’re trans and you’re traveling to small cities. Some of them aren’t as progressive as Los Angeles. And I’m being super honest, on stage about being trans. Just wears on you a lot. I just am not as happy on the road doing comedy anymore. I mean, honestly, I don’t know. It’s really hard. Because every time I try to leave stand up, it feels like an opportunity comes that kind of pulls me back in. You’re doing what you love. And people are loving what you’re doing. And you see the reactions. And secondly, it really was like being able to give back and do comedy at the same time. I get that like so I would do typically an hour show then I would do the 30 Minute Q&A, okay. And then I also said on stage, if you are too shy also to come up to me after the show I completely understand. And those are the times where like, people after meeting me sometimes cried and dealt with their problems or learned stuff about being trans. I had this show that I’ll never ever forget. I did a regular show on a college campus. And I got a message after I was done. That said, hey, Jeffrey. I am the 45-year-old man who is at your show yesterday. And I want to let you know, I have always truly felt like a woman. And for an hour and a half yesterday, for the first time in 45 years, I felt normal. So it was important to me that I go to any town, if something were to happen and didn’t matter, being willing to be that person is really important to me. This person reached out to me, they’ve just looking for an outlet and someone to talk to. And so you can be there for them for a second. But like, you know, they’re still dealing with it when you leave. They’re still dealing with their own lives and a small town. So

Theresa  20:43

That sounds really hard. It’s a lot to put on you.

Chloe  21:17

How are you? Emily is one of my friends from home who I really trust. She gives great advice and has a lot of insight that not many people have.

Emily  21:30

The last time we talked, I knew you had gone on a date. Right? And then what happened since then?

Chloe  21:35

So I mean, she decided that we wouldn’t see each other again. But it’s actually fine, because she gave me the best reason for it. And she said that she’s only into masculine women. And I don’t fit that. And I was like, oh, I’m actually okay with that. I was kind of surprised to hear back from Eve that she just wanted to be friends. And I totally get where she’s coming from and why. But if I’m being honest with myself, it still feels kind of like rejection. So I’ve been talking this guy from a dating app. And we’ve just been chatting and kind of joking around a little bit, and he seems pretty interesting.

Emily  22:17

Are you gonna meet him?

Chloe  22:18

So, he asked me to go get a drink. And this is like, the first time that somebody was like, hey, want to do something? And that doesn’t happen a lot. So I’m excitedly nervous.

Emily  22:31

Wait. So his idea was to meet you in public?

Chloe  22:34

Yes, he was. He was like, yeah, we can grab a drink. And I was like, awesome. I’m always a little nervous.

Emily  22:45

Well, of course, but it’s in public. And you have your phone on you.

Chloe  22:50

One silver lining of being on all these apps is that I’m still talking to some interested and interesting people. The one where I’ve gotten the most interest is actually from a cisgender guy, which I don’t know, like, I want to be incredibly careful, because there’s always some kind of violence being done towards trans women. And a lot of it is from Cis men. But it was his idea to meet up. And it was his idea to meet up in public, which makes me feel a little bit safer. You know, also, this would be my first time going out with a guy, and that’s a whole thing.

Emily  23:20

To be fair, my experience is only going out with guys. I mean, what makes you most nervous?

Chloe  23:25

It’s so new? Like, I have no experience? I don’t know what I’m doing.

Emily  23:28

I mean, are you? Are you considering it, though? Because you think you should you know, like you’re a woman? And that’s the expectation from our society? Or are you actually like pursuing this person? Because he is interesting to you, and you are attracted to him.

Chloe  23:43

While you kind of ask the hard questions.

Emily  23:45

I’m sorry, I know I do that to you all the time.

Chloe  23:47

I know, but it’s really good for me. Because now I actually have to think about it. I don’t exactly know what I want or like, so I’m not really in a position where I feel like I want to turn anyone down just based on gender.

Emily  24:01

Like gender dynamics in general. Like, how different is it? It might feel different for you to be engaging with a guy instead of a woman.

Chloe  24:11

Yeah. And it’ll be really interesting to see how that works out in person.

Emily  24:17

I’m glad that it’s in public. You tell me when you’re going to be there. And that you can let me know how it goes. You’re going to be great.

Jessica  24:35

Hey, Jeffrey, thanks for getting on this call with me. I’m Jessica. I’m the show runner. How are you doing?

Jeffrey  24:43

I’m good. Thanks, Jessica. A friend of mine put me in for an assistant gig in a TV writers room. And amazingly, I have gotten to the interview stage.

Jessica  24:55

Your resume has come to me and looks like you’ve been busy.

Jeffrey  25:00

I wanted to be a TV writers as before, I wanted to be a comedian. But I put it on hold. I started doing stand-up and seeing them took off. And I can make my living doing it. Landing any job at all in a TV writers room would be the perfect way for me to step away from the college comedy circuit.

Jessica  25:20

And I just wanted to talk with you a little bit more about what you’ve what you’ve been up to why you think you’re a good fit here. And yeah, just tell me about yourself.

Jeffrey  25:31

Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. And yeah, I have been busy. I was a comedian for the past 10 years professionally on the college circuit.

Jessica  25:45

If you had to name one of your weaknesses, what would it be?

Jeffrey  25:52

One of my weaknesses right now would probably be inexperience. Well, I have worked a lot of admin jobs. I don’t know the ins and outs of TV writing, and there will be a touch of a learning curve. But I will tell you that I will read everything that comes my way. I will spend extra time on things. But that being said, I am coming in a bit green. So you know, I don’t know something that someone else might already know. I believe you can create your own reality. But the reason I believe that is because I work really hard. I wake up super early. I stay up late. I make time for things that matter and I set myself deadlines. Just what to do.

Jessica  26:40

Well, thank you so much. I guess what I need to know from you is what your availability looks like I’m seeing a handful more people for the position. But if we get back in touch with you within a week, is that okay for you?

Jeffrey  26:55

Absolutely. My availability is 100% I am game and you have me as much as you want or need me. I thought that interview went super well. But it might just be me because I want this so badly. Everything’s very competitive. So I honestly have no idea.

Jessica  27:18

Thank you so much. We’ll be in touch.

Chloe  27:44

No, somebody else is showing up. I just got to the restaurant for our date. And I have my usual butterflies of course, but I’m really looking forward to connecting with somebody new. I’m going to wait just for a minute to see when he gets here. Okay, great. I’ll check back. Okay, thank you. Yeah, you know, I’ll have the, the Belgian wheat. And he should be here shortly. A pint please. Hey, how’s it going?

Emily  29:03

Hey, it’s going okay. Did you get your drink?

Chloe  29:07

So its been about 15 minutes. Is it too soon to text him like I don’t want to be clingy or annoying.

Emily  29:13

Of he hasn’t checked in with you to say, hey, I’m running late or something came up or I would say wait a little bit longer. It’s only been 15 minutes. Traffic can be wonky. Like give it a little bit of time.

Chloe  29:38

Actually, can I have the check? Thank you. I am absolutely humiliated. I’ve been sitting at this table for 30 minutes. He’s obviously not coming. I’ve obviously been stood up. And this is just absolutely awful. Hey, so, I looked and he deleted the app or unmatched me or something like I have no way to get a hold of him. So I am just getting out of here.

Emily  30:13

Oh, Chloe, I’m so sorry, what a dick.

Chloe  30:16

Like, I’m trying really hard to not let this get to me. But it’s kind of getting to me like, I think I had too high of expectations.

Emily  30:26

Here’s the thing though, Chloe having an expectation that somebody is going to show up for a date you’ve scheduled is not too high of an expectation. Okay, so this is completely on him. And if he’s going to do something like this, then I’d rather you not date him because he’s a jerk.

Chloe  30:41

I just need to kind of reset. I wish I was there. Talk crap about this jerk. You need to come back and visit me. Thanks, Emily.

Emily  30:56

I’ll talk to you soon.

Monica  31:16

Hey Jeffrey, it’s Monica. How are ya?

Jeffrey  31:18

I’m good. What’s the word?

Monica  31:21

You know, I just had a couple of dates. I’m gonna run past you. Do you have a minute?

Jeffrey  31:25

Yeah, let me just pull up my calendar real quick. Okay, great. Okay, Monica is with one of the college agencies who kind of puts me out for college shows. And I didn’t expect for her to call immediately after I got back.

Monica  31:37

So looking at block booking, three dates, thinking, right now that’s looking like the 15, 16, 17. Not a weekend’s not inclusive. Because one of them wants to do a training. So there’ll be a second day, which you know, is double price.

Jeffrey  32:00

Yeah. The problem is, I don’t really know my schedule. Like, do you know if any of them has any flexibility like to do just weekends?

Monica  32:14

I can check with them. But I don’t think so.

Jeffrey  32:21

I’m still waiting to hear back from Jessica, about the possible assistance position. And so saying yes to the college gigs could jeopardize that because I would need to start that immediately. The problem was saying no, right now is that then they don’t want to book you anymore. And so then, before you know it, you don’t get any phone calls. So I’m choosing my words very carefully here. But I’m also scared. Okay, let me check with everything. And I’ll get right back to you. […]

Emma  33:16

It’s been pretty good.

Jeffrey  33:19

So, you didn’t fly this morning, huh?

Emma  33:21

I didn’t, no, the winds are too strong.

Jeffrey  33:24

I miss you, baby. And I’m really proud of you. And I can’t believe how crazy your schedule is going to be and how many hours you’re going to be in the air.

Emma  33:32

Yeah, if I can. As long as weather doesn’t bog us down, I’m gonna be getting like 24 hours a month of flight time.

Jeffrey  33:41

It’s amazing. Because that’s what I’m really missing him a lot right now. And I’m trying not to burden her with all of my work stuff. Because she has a lot of stuff going on too. And she’s in school. And it’s just, it’s just a lot. It is freaking wedding season. Oh my God. Have you not seen that everybody’s getting married right now? Actually, every single weekend, there’s a marriage. And they seem like they’re all gay. Do we only know gay people?

Emma  34:12

You only know gay people.

Jeffrey  34:15

I think that might be the case. Is that or the only gay people I know that get married? Or maybe those are the only ones that catch my eye because they’re the only ones that are Instagrammable. I think the thing is, is that I’m in constant fear that you will propose to me.

Emma  34:36

It’s not a great fear to have in a relationship

Jeffrey  34:39

For a while you had that safe?

Emma  34:41

Well, you thought you had the money to just buy a ring and hide it. I don’t have the money to propose to you right now anyway. Like, I’m not going to pop a proposal right now because we both agreed it’s not the right time for it to happen.

Jeffrey  35:00

for both me and Emma, we see our relationship as a priority. Like we see each other as each other’s forever person and is actively working towards her dream of being a helicopter pilot. But at the same time, she keeps our future in mind and makes it a priority. And I just want to make sure I’m always doing the same. And I really do want to marry you. And I want to make sure that that we don’t shortchange ourselves on a cool last wedding.

Emma  35:27

How would you propose though? I don’t know, like, what you would do?

Jeffrey  35:34

That I keep to myself, you will never know what I’m planning. I love you so much.

Emma  35:43

I love you. I gotta go catch a flight. So I’ll talk to you later.

Chloe  35:59

Hi, how are you?

Emily  36:02

Great.

Chloe  36:03

I’ve been pretty down since getting stood up, to be honest. And it’s getting really hard to continuously put myself out there and not have anything happen. Emily and I catch a phone call. Because we’ve been texting. And she’s been checking in on me, which I’m so appreciative of, but I just need to talk to her.

Emily  36:19

No, but really, I really want to hear the scoop. Any other blind dates?

Chloe  36:24

No blind dates yet? I’ve started some cursory conversations on some of the apps, like, a couple people didn’t unmatch me immediately. So I’m like, you know, chatting with them a little bit.

Emily  36:35

That makes me so sad is that some kind of?

Chloe  36:39

Yeah, when people read my profile, and see that I’m trans, they unmatch a lot, which is frustrating and makes me angry and kind of hurts.

Emily  36:49

I was very nervous to be on an app, because I’m a plus size woman, I was very concerned that no one was going to swipe for me. And so for me, like any angles, you know, I just am honest. And I say right off the bat in the bio, you know, plus size woman, bla bla bla bla bla. And so I know that whoever swipes on me isn’t going to be surprised or disappointed, be upfront about the thing that you’re most insecure about. And I feel like that’s sort of what you’ve done, like you put in your pile that you’re trans. You don’t hide that fact, you know?

Chloe  37:21

Yeah, and that is good advice. Like, it’s a lot easier for somebody to unmask me than it is to interact with them, or they just become a complete jerk. When like, when you’re dating and like using the apps, like what are some of the hurdles or obstacles or like, gee, that’s kind of effed up kind of moments.

Emily  37:37

I mean, my situation is very unique in its own way. Like I’m jaded and very, very jaded about men, and about my experience, and some of the things that I had happen in my relationship that I just kind of thought were normal, but that I now know are not. I actually think that in some ways, there’s a lot of value and like entering the dating world, like you are without a ton of experience, because I feel like your expectations are realistic, at least not, you don’t have like, for example, a person that you’re comparing everybody to, I feel like you’re more of like an open book in the sense that you’re willing to kind of see where things go in a truly authentic way. Do you know what I mean?

Chloe  38:27

Yeah, my, why you kind of call me out like that. No, that’s so legit. Like, I feel like you just saw into my soul. Like that’s like legit, I had never thought about that before.

Emily  38:40

And the fact that you’re at the point in your life, where you not only know who you are, but you’re accepting of it, and you’re starting to learn what it means to really like yourself. I think that’s when you start to attract other people who will like you too, you know, like, that’s sort of how that plays out. Because I can remember the difference and it makes me feel so warm in my heart and soul knowing that you are able to own who you are, but also that you are starting to like that person because I want I like you so much. I love you. I think you’re like one of the best people on this earth. And I want for you to see that so that other people when you’re dating them and you’re developing relationships with other people that they see that too, because you’re worth it, you know, and you’ve made a lot of progress. So I’m thrilled about it.

Chloe  39:28

Oh my god, that means the world to me, Emily, like some of the things you just said, like, you’re worth it. Like I didn’t believe that for so long. As you know. Emily has given me a lot to think about, especially when I’ve never thought of things that way before. And it’s really nice to have somebody to take the time to offer those thoughts to me, while still being compassionate about what happened. All right, well, I think I’m gonna get going because I have to call my mom shortly. I will text you in a little while.

Jeffrey  40:13

Hello, this is my first voice memo on my new phone. It says my address. Okay, that’s creepy. I’m trying to be cheery because I got an email back from Jessica the showrunner this morning and I didn’t get the writers PA job. But that’s okay. I’m also currently emailing my agent Monica. And I’ve decided I’m turning down the college dates, even though she’s trying to book me out. So what’s probably going to happen now she’s probably going to stop reaching out to me for gigs. And now that’s okay, I’ve made peace with it, I’m gonna send my resume out everywhere I can. I’m gonna focus on writing, I’m gonna work on some, like, my original scripts, and I’ll keep submitting to things and eventually something’s gonna happen. Like, this is kind of that tipping point for me where I just have to make a choice. And I’m gonna go for it, even if it’s effing terrifying. Ah, I think what it is, is that, like, I go on the road, and I’m always waiting for like, something big to happen to pull me off. But I just have to make the decision for myself, I’m just going to take charge in and just do it and take the chance. That’s what I did with comedy to begin with. And then that’s what’s going to create the future that I want in my career, and, you know, with Emma, as far as the way I can reach people with my stand up, I’m definitely gonna miss that. But I know that with writing, I even have a chance to like, reach more people. And yeah, I don’t know. It’s scary. But that’s what life is. Like, you have to take a chance in order to get the things that really matter to you. And I mean, that’s how you grow and like become the person that you want to be.

Chloe  42:54

Right now I’m at a park to attend a queer speed dating event. And like, I’ve had a lot of disappointments lately, but I know that I’m not going to meet my future partner sitting alone in my apartment. I’ll be honest, something like this would generally freak me out. But if I don’t meet my person here, that’s okay, too. Hi, Alex. I’m Chloe. I wrote like a personal says my headline is, let’s go. And it’s let’s go to your favorite places. And I’ll show you mine. Let’s go to places we haven’t even thought or heard of yet. Let’s go together. Let’s go.

Alex  43:33

Hi, I’m Alex. I like giant sweaters, making fun of bad movies, and all things nerdy. I want you to tell me your passions and get me excited about something new. Let’s do something that we’re both not good at […]

Chloe  43:49

That sounds awesome. I’m Chloe, she/her/hers.

X  44:02

The awesome. I am X.

Chloe  44:04

X, It’s nice to meet you. Honestly, it’s really nice to be around other queer people.

X  44:09

Absolutely. Like this is my first gay event like that. I’ve been out to like since I’ve moved to LA so it’s like nice to like be like 100% surrounded by like, hundreds.

Chloe  44:20

There are just so many obstacles to trans dating. But the only way anything is ever going to happen is if I keep showing up, and I have to keep showing up for myself. I spent probably way too much time this week thinking about what did I do wrong on these days? What could I have done better? And honestly, I need to stop thinking that way. I am great. And it’s only a matter of time before somebody else figures out that I’m great too. And I just have to keep going I have to see what happens because I deserve to be loved and I felt like held to be who I am today. And I deserve better and I deserve to treat myself better.

Unfit = """
Dascha Polanco  00:37

My black and white Nike blazers hit the pavement in the parking lot of Men’s Central Jail. Immediately I felt the warm sun on my skin as I stepped off the LA County bus. The word probation was printed across the back of my shirt and down the side of my pants. A heavy silver chain had me bounds at the wrist and another one restraining my ankles. There is a long road ahead of me. This is only the beginning. Right now I am not sure that there is a light at the end of this tunnel. I’m only 17 and as a female, I was full of emotion, but had to learn the art of masking. I was scared of the unknown. On my way to court, surrounded me with all the women from Lynwood county dressed in all blue. The holding cells were packed with inmates on every side so much that corrections had nowhere to put me. Since I was a minor I had to be escorted. Today I was escorted to an old rusted filthy bathroom next to the holding cells.

Dascha Polanco 

The smell of urine was overpowering as I walked through the door I heard it securely locked behind me. All the noise from people yelling, singing, laughing and talking started to drown out. To make myself as comfortable as possible. That’s a casino on the […] I was standing up against the wall. I chains were tight on my wrist. They were chafing my skin. I couldn’t relax. We’ll get out of them. I looked at the walls covered in peanut butter and jelly behind the sink and toilet bowl flooded with trash as I sit. Inmates were starting to get called out for court. He got quieter and quieter as people are getting escorted to their bus. Where is my bus? Did they forget me? I pounded on the door each time I heard keys passing by I was ignored. I started to think about my mom. She’s probably wondering where I’m at. I was no stranger to trouble. But this time there was no way out. I was powerless. Then someone yelled, little baby, are you still in there? I barely replied.

Dascha Polanco  02:55

Yeah. I saw her tattooed hand stretched through the gap between the floor and bottom of the door with a baby blue pocket Bible. She said, read this. I struggle to reach for it in my chamber. When I grabbed it. It was open to a chapter called James. It said my brethren, console joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience, but let patients have it’s perfect work that you may be perfect and complete lacking nothing. Nothing changed. I was still in the same raggedy old field the bathroom […] of urine. Except I grabbed a hold of the idea that no struggle is forever. And I put my game face back on as soon as I heard a key answer that lock. When the sheriff opened the door. I thank the lady and threw her Bible back to her through the bars. My bus had finally come.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez  04:06

I’m Walter Thompson-Hernandez and this is WRITTEN OFF. You just heard from actress Dascha Polanco, one of the Latinx stars of Netflix’s Orange is the New Black. She read The Unfit by IOW Alum Olivia Carrasco. Olivia is actually wearing Nike blazers during our conversation. Not the exact pair she mentioned at the beginning of her piece, but they still fit in with her all-black look. She’s also got these tiny diamonds on her white acrylic nails. The all black everything with a tiny bit of shine seems fitting even as one of the newest IOW Alum’s. Olivia was quick to show interest in taking part in this podcast. She’s got that confidence mixed in with humility that draws you to her when you meet. At first, she comes off quiet and timid, but the minute we start talking, she turns bright and confident. She’s self-assured. Even in her nerves. She definitely fits in here. What’s it feel like hearing someone read your story?

Olivia Carrasco 

I feel like I just relived the whole thing. I was really blown away, by the way, she was able to, like capture my emotion in the piece of writing without even knowing. But I definitely felt like all emotions all over again. And I felt like I was there. So I think she did a good job of like, capturing what happened.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez 

What kinds of motion did you feel?

Olivia Carrasco 

All of them, like, I literally felt like I was in that bathroom again, and kind of being scared, because I didn’t know what was going to happen. But then at the same time, like, I was hopeless already. So I was just like, felt defeated, kind of.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez  06:10

And the actual, like, writing process. What was that like? Because it you know, it really feels like were there with you. Right? Whether it’s like the peanut butter and jelly reference, the Bible, the Nike blazers, the tattooed hand, reaching under that door, like how did you, how are you able to, to make that happen? How’d you do that?

Olivia Carrasco 

There are certain parts of my life that I can remember every detail of it, of that memory. So I guess as a writer, I’m able to keep captured what I felt at the moment, when I saw whatever I saw, or I did whatever I did, or whatever situation I was in. As a writer. I feel like putting it down on paper and expressing how everything was detail by detail, emotion by emotion is almost like therapeutic to me. So, writing the piece, I guess I kind of relive it every time. Like I write something in order to get like the full story. But I actually wrote that when I was in isolation, right before I got out. So I was kind of replaying my whole journey. And that was kind of at the beginning of my journey. And I wrote it when I was at the end of it.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez 

If you could walk me through actually writing it, like, sounds, smells, what you wrote it with, what that day was like?

Olivia Carrasco 

It was cold. I remember. Even the bus was cold. And feeling the sun. Like the warmth, was like something that I craved because this like we never were, we’re out, I think and then all of those things, I think subconsciously, were affecting me and I didn’t realize is just kind of like the process of being incarcerated. But, the smells were so like, distinct, like, I can never forget them. They’re disgusting. But like, I wouldn’t just like seeing certain things. Certain memories just stuck in my head, I guess. And so that’s how I was able to just put it down on paper. But that was a really long day for me. And it turned out actually better than I expected in the end. Because at the end of that I felt more relieved. After I had captured that, like idea that this wasn’t gonna be forever, this wasn’t going to be my life forever. I wasn’t going to be stuck in that box forever. I had some kind of hope, I guess at the end of that day, but it was a hard day.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez 

Has always been like a part of this, like creative practice for you?

Olivia Carrasco 

No, I actually never wrote until I was in juvenile hall. And InsideOUT writers came. And my teacher, his name was Robert Fox, and he would come like faithfully every single weekend to teach us how to like, how to write and I never wanted to participate. I was so hard headed and like, especially if it had to like be anything that had to do with my emotions or whatever. Like I never want like I cannot put pen to paper and write anything down. So I remember like I didn’t want to participate. And he told me well write that down, write down that you don’t want to participate. And I was like, okay, and then he’s like, what else is on your mind? And I’m like, I don’t know, he’s like, write that down, write down, you don’t know what’s on your mind. And I’m like, so I was he pushed me to just throw my thoughts out there on paper. And once I did, I discovered that there was so much that I was holding in. And I was kind of I was scared to share, like, he was asking people to share, and he kept on pushing me because he knew I didn’t want to, I don’t know. But the more he pushed me like, I was just like, fine, I’ll just do it just to so that he won’t keep on asking me.

Olivia Carrasco  10:48

And then once I did it, I remember it was a really emotional day because I put my emotions down on paper. And one thing about being incarcerated is like sometimes that could be seen as like a form of weakness, or people will judge you. And I actually, when I read my piece, everybody in the room could relate, regardless of everybody’s differences, and neighborhoods or whatever, everybody was able to relate to the piece of writing and the emotions that we go through. Being in the situation that we were in. We were all considered unfit, which is the title of the piece. Because we weren’t not fit to be charged as juveniles, we were being charged as adults. So as minors going through that situation. I think that writing class brought a lot of healing to all of us, because we were able to connect on that level. And kind of it was a sense of like, we’re not alone in this. So kind of felt like family after a while. Because we would get to know each other on it on a different level. So then, that’s when writing became like an outlet for me. Whenever I would go through something, writing always helped. And I never forgot, like, what I was taught when I was there.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez  12:37

There’s a part like towards the end of your piece where you talk about putting on a game face. Like, I love to learn more about what that means.

Olivia Carrasco 

Your game faces kind of like, projecting the idea that nothing’s facing you or that you’re okay. When you’re really not, I guess. It’s like a mask. It’s just liked a cover up, I guess. And it’s something that I was used to doing all the time. Whenever the doors open, it was like your mask goes on. And I don’t know if it’s like a form of protection, I guess, while you’re incarcerated, but like, that’s what I meant by that.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez 

Was it also a moment when you realize that, that writing and sharing in that way, like wasn’t actually a form of weakness, where it was kind of the opposite? Where it was really empowering, and, you know, really a way to connect with others?

Olivia Carrasco 

Yeah, first for myself, like, I think that kind of like helped me break that wall down of like pride, I guess. Kind of going back to like that game face everything just being real and honest with myself. writing about my true emotions and how I viewed things, was empowering to myself. So once it was empowering to myself, and I was able to share it, other people were empowered too and they also would do the same and it would inspire me to continue to write. So I think it was after that, like, stubbornness that I had, that I discovered that it was it was empowering and not weak to talk about real things.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez

I’m also curious if you consider yourself a spiritual person?

Olivia Carrasco 

I definitely believe like, in good and evil. I would consider myself as spiritual person but not to like I’m not going to say like that I’m a good person or anything like that, because Like, I know, I have a bad side, I have a good side, I have bad side. But, um, as far as like, my spiritual beliefs go, I know it exists. I know it’s real. And I mean, there’s been a lot of moments like, like the one that I wrote about in the piece that have happened to me throughout my lifetime and throughout my time incarcerated where nobody knew what I was going through, and something like that would come in, come my way. And it’s like, how did that happen? And it was, a lot of times, it was like, maybe exactly what I needed to hear in order to move on or to keep on going. So I definitely believe that it’s there.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez 

Is there like a version of your life today? Like, imagine your life without writing? What does that look like?

Olivia Carrasco 

Like a trap. Like, I would feel trapped. Like your voice is gone. It’d be like lonely. I think. Whether you’re hurt or not. Writing is getting out. Like, your thoughts. It’s getting out. What you believe. And without judgment. So I find like freedom in that.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez  16:27

Are you still writing today?

Olivia Carrasco

Yeah. So, every week, I still meet up with InsideOUT writers every Thursday for the writing circles, like virtually. And every time a teacher gives us a prompt, and we all right, it’s the same thing. It’s like, I feel like I’m back in juvenile hall when we were all writing together and sharing together. It’s that same sense of family, that same sense of, like togetherness, I guess. So. Yeah. And these, like, Jimmy was like one of the first people that I contacted when I got out because I knew how important this was to me. And it impacted my life and in a way that it probably saved me out of a lot of situations.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez

When you were a kid, like 10 years old, what did you think a writer was? It’s been a minute. It’s been a minute for sure. 10-year-old Olivia. How is she? What does she like? And what does she think a writer is?

Olivia Carrasco

angry, I know I was definitely angry at that age. I’m rebellious. I’m really close minded about people and things and situations. easily influenced by my surroundings. And by 10 years old, I was already getting high and drinking so and you know, actually, there’s one person that I kind of grew up with, that was really well known in my neighborhood that had gone to juvenile hall before. really young, and he would write I remember, and I thought it was so weird. I’m like, what, like, you write like, I don’t know. And then he’s like, yeah, is that so shocking? And I’m like, well, yeah, kind of like, what do you I never knew exactly what he would write about, but I know that there would be times where he would like when he’s by himself, he would write and I thought that was interesting. And I guess, coming from someone like that, I was kind of open to it. But never did it myself. Just because at that age, I was just running around going crazy. But, I think, him being incarcerated. He kind of experienced that, like, isolation and, like, found like, it’s kind of like writing was therapeutic. So me not having experienced that yet. I hadn’t actually done it yet. But, I always remembered that so I wasn’t completely closed off to it. I just thought, like, for the most part, writers were people who wrote books authors. I don’t know it wasn’t of much like I didn’t think much about it. Until I actually started writing myself.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez

So at 10, you stood in a you wouldn’t know that you would one day also become a writer?

Olivia Carrasco

No. My dad has been incarcerated since I was three years old. He’s been on death row now for about 25 years. And he has always written me like letters, even when I was a kid. And when I was able to write even as a kid, I would write him back. And I remember hearing my mom say, like, they I was a good writer, like, the way I was able to, to word things. I remember hearing that, like, from her and like, my attitude, because they would read my letter sometimes before they would send them out. And I remember hearing that, but it just never occurred to me like that I would ever be a writer or anything. I just remember them saying like that, the way I write the way I word things, like you have a gift for writing.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez

Are you still writing into your dad?

Olivia Carrasco

Yeah, right now. He’s actually he’s getting older, and he’s kind of sick. So I don’t talk to him as much. So he developed Parkinson’s disease. So it’s hard for him to write because his hands shake a lot. So I don’t get nearly as many letters as I used to because of that. Since I’ve been out, I guess the Parkinson’s he’s had it for a few years now. And it just keeps getting worse and worse. So the more aggressive it gets, the less I hear from him. Because it’s harder for him to function. But I’m still definitely in contact with him. He’s been one of the very few people who have been like a major support to me throughout my time. And I’m really close with my dad. So yeah.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez  22:06

And when you were incarcerated, did you write to him?

Olivia Carrasco

He would write to me like faithfully every single week. So he wrote a lot more than I did. I appreciated all his letters, because whatever I was going through in there many times, like I would get a letter. And it was like, always what I needed to hear, like, right on time, he was able to, like, reach me in that way. And when I would write back, it was like the same thing. So through writing, we were actually able to, like connect on probably more intimate level than like people who actually have their dads right there. I’m so thankful for that.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez

What your dad write about in his letters?

Olivia Carrasco

My dad has always been kind of like a guide to me. He never judged like what I did, so I was able to freely tell him anything that I was doing, or what was going on without feeling like I was gonna be punished or anything, all for one. Like he was incarcerated. So that wasn’t really that but what I mean is like, I felt like I had a friend in him, as well as like a father figure. But, most of his letters were just guidance like he would share with me his experiences at my age, and what he went through at my age, that kind of like, made me more open to what he was saying, I guess he wasn’t like ever telling me No, don’t do this or don’t do that. Like he just shared with me what happened when he did it. Left the decision up to me whether I wanted to do that or not. And I was stupid and made dumb decisions anyways, but throughout my whole incarceration, he always like encouraged me to never give up. And to always like, stay positive. He was always his letters were always positive. And just, they were always really short. Like just one page. But his words were always enough to get me, to get me through.

Walter Thompson-Hernandez  24:41

If you can tell me like who you are today, what you’re interested in, what you read, what you write.

Olivia Carrasco

My values have changed over time. Now I value like family. My real Like my true friends, I value a different kind of respect. And my freedom. I am trying, I’m also transitioning into like adulthood out here. So I’m learning like, how, how to handle, um, just like adult things, and also aligning them with my values. So I just spend my free time like in a positive way, a productive way. I try to put like effort into seeing my family more, everything was so broken when I got out. And I feel like everything that I lost, now I just I want to gain back. So I think today, I care a lot more. I never had these values before. So I would say that today. My eyes are open, and I’m a lot more grateful to what’s around me and what I have every day. Even if it’s not a lot, it’s a whole lot more than what I had. So I like spending time with friends. I like spending time with family, I like going out I like going to the beach. I like going, I like driving my car, sometimes I like getting away sometimes. And just being in my thoughts and thinking about my life. My goals, what I want to do. I look forward to the writing circles, I look forward to my job, even the job that I have. So I’m just getting the hang of things like that. And daily, I think I just see myself changing more and more because I’m not even trying to it’s just the more I realize, like how much I have, the more I don’t want to lose it. And so that I think affects like all the decisions that I make. So I don’t know, I think today I’m just a lot more caring.

Is there anything that like, you’d like to share that I haven’t asked you so far?

Olivia Carrasco

Yeah. When I got out. I didn’t realize how hard it was going to be for me to get a job. I thought I would be able to get a job like that. And I was in San Diego for a while. And I got I was working at like Vons. And it was so easy for me to get hired over there. And when I pulled out here, nobody was hiring me like I was getting, I would pass the interviews, and they would want to hire me. But soon as they ran my background check, it was like an automatic no. And I would get letters in the mail saying why they denied me. And every letter was because of my background. And I was like, dang, I didn’t know that was a real thing, I thought I would be able to get it like it’s LA, there’s jobs everywhere. And I was just getting shut down everywhere. And the more I thought about I was like, well, I know there’s purpose and everything like, but I want a job where I’m doing something that I’m actually like passionate about. And I was trying to tap more into that.

Olivia Carrasco  28:02

And this opportunity came up that Jimmy offered to me with an organization called California justice leaders and what they do is they help young adults with resources for when they get out. And they also they just point them in the right direction. And also like if they were interested in getting their record sealed, like we walk them through the process of getting, getting their felonies, like they’ll be discharged. But then they can use that as evidence as like rehabilitation. So that if they wanted to get their record sealed, they can use that as evidence of rehabilitation, so and that would open up more opportunities for them to pursue whatever career they want, instead of being hopeless, and just thinking this is it, I’m never gonna go anywhere. Or, like, my background is like, a barrier to everything I want to do I know how that feels like, dang, I couldn’t even get a job at the market.

Olivia Carrasco

Like there shouldn’t be down for everything. So there’s a lot of like careers that even my friends that I have friends that they would want to be like in the medical field and they can’t because they’re felonies or there’s a lot of things that there’s a lot of benefits to getting their record cleared. So from for me to be able to have the opportunity to be a part of that and helping them with that. I feel is like really purposeful and meaningful. So it’s kind of like paying it forward to I’m not eligible for that. But if I can help somebody else, like move forward then I thought that was like a perfect opportunity and it came my way so I was really grateful for that and appreciate life.

Carrie = """
Carrie  00:02

Something inside me said, go look through his stuff. I don’t know why I can’t explain it to this day, something said, go to his office and look through stuff.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  00:17

It’s 2019 and Carrie is standing outside her husband’s office. The doorway is the only thing separating her from the completely normal life she knows, and a secret that will ruin everything.

Carrie  00:32

Got to bed and slept next to me every night like everything was fine and normal. Like how could I not have seen it? How could I have been so stupid? I have a doctorate For fuck sake. How did I not see this happening right in front of my face.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  01:01

This is LAST DAY, a show about the moments that change us. I’m Stephanie Wittels Wachs. And today, we have one of the most egregious stories of betrayal you might ever hear. It’s the story of being deceived, manipulated, and swindled by the one person in the world, who vowed to love you forever, how you continue to put one foot in front of the other and start over with nothing.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  01:39

Carrie met Joe when she was in graduate school studying to get her doctorate in veterinary medicine. And just a few years later, in 2006, they got married.

Carrie  01:50

At the beginning, it was I think what anyone would describe their marriage partner. You know, I felt like I had a teammate. I knew I wanted to have children with him. We didn’t see eye to eye on everything. But we had what I thought was good communication. And I loved him. He was fun. Everyone likes hanging out with him. So he was just like a normal guy. Just, that’s how I can best describe it.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  02:17

Like a good guy.

Carrie  02:18

A good guy. Yeah, he was good to his mom, you know, had a relationship with both of his parents liked animals like I did. And, you know, he just seemed like, a good, good person.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  02:34

These two good people fall in love and eventually start a family. Four years after getting married, Carrie gives birth to their daughter. And four years later, their son, Carrie describes Jo as a doting dad, someone who often had more patience for the kids than she did. It was a good balance. But like she said, they didn’t always see eye to eye.

Carrie  02:58

I am the kind of person that I mean, some people would say overly opinionated if I have a thought if I have a feeling. Let’s just put it out there. Now I want to talk about it now. And I always would joke that Joe had two sides, there was normal Joe, and there was like, unhappy slash angry, and not a lot of range in the emotional field, at least not that he would show. And so if there was ever a disagreement, I would say, I’d like to talk about this. And Joe would be time. But that time always turned into stretching it out so far that then I’d say okay, it’s been three days. We talked about this. Now, I don’t remember what it was about is that would be his response. So something like avoidant things, saying when he he needed time to focus on something, but then in the long run, really just avoiding the discussion. And I would say that was not as major at the beginning, but it was still there. Right. And I think it just grew larger over time.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  04:02

Joseph Boyden communication style aside, Carrie and Joe had a pretty typical marriage, and they were able to provide a comfortable life for their kids. Carrie had her accomplished, yet demanding career as a bet. And Joe, meanwhile, worked in the business world, sometimes for global corporations.

Carrie  04:21

From the outside, we look like a very typical family. You know, we were friends with other families. We had couples friends that we hung out with a lot. Everyone thought we were fun. Everyone thought we had a good marriage. I had a friend that said, Oh, I wish I had a marriage like yours. I mean, there were ups and downs. I mean, every marriage has it your marriage you get it. It’s hard work to maintain a long term relationship, whether that’s romantic or otherwise it takes effort, but I feel like overall outwardly we appeared to be a pretty normal run of the mill family of four.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  04:59

In 2014 In the family moves to a different state. So Joe can work at an even bigger company.

Carrie  05:04

You know, he was the primary breadwinner, especially since I wanted to be home halftime. So my income was more ancillary. And so the, our first big move was for a career move for him. And that one was, was hard for me it was right after my son was born. And I really loved where we were living. And I had a really good community of friends and colleagues that were, we didn’t have family nearby, so they felt like my chosen family. So that was a really difficult move for me. And I don’t admit, I had a bad attitude about it for a bit. And then, you know, I finally snapped out of it and said, a place is what you make of it, this is your new home, you know, make it work, you can choose to be unhappy, or you can choose to make this work. Where I was at that point in my life was, I can pick up my career at any time, his career is allowing me to have some time with these kids. And I’m never gonna get these years back. So, you know, it’s okay to take a backseat for a little bit.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  06:10

Carrie starts to cut back on her hours at work to spend more time with the kids until eventually she decides to stay home altogether. Then in 2017, Carrie starts to notice a shift in Joe, he seems stressed and preoccupied, less engaged with her and the kids. It’s a subtle change in behavior that only she as his spouse would pick up on. She doesn’t exactly know what’s happening. And as we know, he can be pretty avoidant. So she tries to get to the bottom of it in a different way.

Carrie  06:46

His mom had gotten sick, and his behavior changed sort of around that time. So I thought he’s worried about his mom, our relationship with her at that point seems sort of strained on top of it, which was not the norm. I remember calling his brother once and saying, I need you know, can you reach out to Joe? Because something’s off? I don’t know, if he’s anxious or depressed or worried about your mom? Or? Or what? He won’t really speak to me, you know, Has he said anything to you? Can you, you know, any insights there. And, you know, he followed up as I asked him to, and show just basically said, Oh, I’m just stressed with work. And yeah, worried about mom. And, you know, there was excuses and reasons given, there was always some type of feasible explanation. And hindsight, I doubted the explanation, but not enough to challenge it at the time.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  07:49

At this point, Joe is the sole breadwinner in the family and handling pretty much all of the finances, while Carrie continues to focus her energy at home.

Carrie  07:59

We had been kind of on the same page, kind of CO managing finances. And when our kids were born, I don’t know, for some reason, something shifted to me, and it stressed me out and he’s like, it doesn’t stress me out, I’ll take care of it. So I kind of passed that baton to him. As many, you know, relationships are someone each of you divide and conquer your tasks. And so I would call him and say like, the car just got to class. He’s like, Oh, I think we’ve got some fraud on it. And you know, that I then suddenly it would work. Or I would go to try to log into our bank account, and I couldn’t get in. And, you know, he would always be the ones that call and try to figure out what was going on. And like, there’s a problem with the website, and you would forward me emails showing me like, here’s where I talked to the banker, and they’re trying to get this fixed, and they’re gonna pay us a fee for the inconvenience. And my remember my mom’s saying, that doesn’t make any sense. Why would they pay you instead of just fixing it? And I was like, Well, it’s because it’s been going on for so long. It’s taking a while for them to figure it out. I mean, even statements, you know, this was the time where everyone was starting to do online statements. And so statements didn’t really come to our house anymore for anything. And we always had the Postal Service informed delivery, and you get an email every morning telling you what’s coming in the mail that day. And I this is one of the things that still bothers me to this day used to always tell me don’t check the mail today, I got you a present. It’s gonna be there. And hindsight, because then a couple of weeks, I’d be like, Whatever happened to that present? Oh, I know. You wouldn’t like it. I sent it back. And I think he would see what was getting delivered that day and it’d be something he didn’t want me to see. And so he would tell me there was a present for me, and sometimes there was there was presence enough that it was believable, right. So here I think my sweet husband is getting me a gift. It’s not my birthday. It’s not our anniversary. There’s some special occasion. Who am I to doubt him?

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  10:01

Was there any worry like a voice in your head or in your gut? That was like, I think this is it like, did you think he was having an affair? Did you think he was like, did you have suspicions of anything?

Carrie  10:16

I never worried about an affair. I did a couple times wonder just because of the account things if it was money. And then I would again, always doubt myself because bank statements would be presented other things that would, were supposed to squash my fears. You know, when I would say I can’t log into this over here, here’s this Oh, okay. Again, I tend to be a pretty think things into the ground, anxious person about some things. And so once I would get those explanations, I would then turn around on myself, like, you’re just a worry, or you worry about everything. Like, what should I worry about, because I don’t have anything that happened today, I will go into my minds into the dredges of my brain. And I will find something to ruminate on and ruin my day over. And so I think it was very easy to tell myself, everything’s fine, you’re looking for a problem, stop trying to make things difficult when they don’t have to be. He knew me better than anyone else. He knew how anxious I got about things. And so, you know, I don’t know if it was ever purposeful or just was easy to fall into place. But I was a very easy person to kind of let their anxieties take care of a lot of the hiding.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  11:43

By July of 2019, Carrie Jo, and the kids relocate again, this time, from the South to the Midwest for Joe’s job. After the cross country move, the family is finally getting settled into their new place.

Carrie  11:59

Kids started back to school at the end of August. And Joe was working at an office in this city, but also work from home Sundays, which was lovely, because we could go grab lunch together before the kids got off the bus and I was getting the house in order. At the time, I believed that we were renting a home that had been flipped by a company and they had said, Hey, we weren’t prepared to buy when we moved there, but it was kind of a rent to own situation. So they were gonna give us permission to make changes in the house and do what we wanted. Or so I thought,

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  12:36

since they were permitted to make renovations, Carrie and Joe decided to remodel the walk in closet and the primary bedroom. Joe tells Carrie, he’s made an appointment for the contractors to stop by in October, the day of their anniversary.

Carrie  12:51

Took down the existing closet, took everything out all the clothes, all of the hardware, everything and put it into the spare room. And he said we should go to breakfast for our anniversary because there’ll be here to do the closet and the afternoon. I said perfect. So we get the kids off to school, go to breakfast, come home, he goes to his office and comes back a little bit later and says bad news. They went to pick up all the stuff for the closet and they they cut it in the wrong color. So they’re not gonna be able to install today. Like, well, that sucks, you know, all of our stuffs laying out what are we going to do? And well, they’re going to talk about when they can get back out here. They’re going to give us a big discount since this is a big inconvenience. There going to be in touch with me. Okay. So the next day, well, they’ve got a couple of really big projects they’re working on this week. It might be next week before they can get it done. But they’re they’re gonna give us a really big discount. Next day. Have you heard from them? Yeah, they’re not able to do it this week. It’ll be sometime next week.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  13:57

The closet renovation keeps getting pushed back further and further until November rolls around.

Carrie  14:04

And the following week, I had a trip planned with a couple of girlfriends. I was trying to pack with all my stuff piled in giant piles. And so the day before I was supposed to leave for my trip, I thought we’ve used these people before and had no problems. I’m going to call myself. And so he was gone that day in the office. And I called and I said hi such and such can’t remember the lady’s name. I was just wondering when you guys were gonna get back out here, you’re gonna get this closet taken care of. It’s just been going on for too long. And I just want to know we have a Resolution Day. And there was a very long pause to what she said. I’m just waiting for your husband to call and give the deposit and schedule it and then we’re gonna get you on the books and silence on my end. Oh, yeah, yeah, I must just say I’ve crossed wires, my husband, sure, sure we’ll be in touch right away. And I remember hanging up the phone and thinking, What the fuck is going on. And something inside me said, go look through his stuff. I don’t know why I can’t explain it to this day, something said, go to his office and look through stuff. And so I ran into the office and I was, you know, like a movie a madwoman just rummaging through papers, and I started finding bills with my name on them. Creditors looking for me, a lot of stuff addressed to peel boxes in my name, I had no idea existed, past due invoices, credit cards, more past two invoices, more Pio box things, and I am like, I called him and I said, I don’t know what the hell is going on, but you need to get home right now.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  16:14

We’re back. After she calls Joe. Carrie immediately calls her friends to let them know what just happened and that she won’t be able to come on the trip. But her friends refuse to let her figure this out alone, and insist that she come. Then, in the midst of all of this, Joe gets home.

Carrie  16:38

There was a lot more gaslighting, he didn’t really explain much. It’s kind of a blur, honestly, that day, had some excuses, oh, it’s not what you think. And I’m gonna get you a list of all the bills we have, and this and that, and, and I said, okay, and I got on the plane, and I went and met my friends. And we started doing our own research. So we tried reaching out to some of those emails from the bank that was supposed to prove the reason why I couldn’t access the account. And they were fake. I mean, they were on letterhead, they had everything. We called the carrier for my student loan, because I had no idea of he’d been paying it. And I was very, very, very, very behind. And to the point, I was getting ready to get in some serious trouble. He had just stopped paying it. He was paying his own student loans. But he had stopped paying mine. And every night I would call him and be like, I need to know the truth. Like, is all the money. I think that’s in our savings. They’re like, what else? Are you lying about? No, no, it’s there. You know, everything. Now, you know, everything now. And that weekend was just a bit of a blur. I didn’t know if I was staying or going. I didn’t know the truth. I just knew that something was really wrong. And I could tell you wasn’t being completely honest.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  18:02

A week and a half passes, where Carrie and her friends keep uncovering more pieces of this puzzle. And after the trip, one of her friends has another bomb to drop.

Carrie  18:13

So I get home from the trip. And one of the women that I was with her husband had been friends with Joe. And we got home maybe on a Monday, Wednesday morning, she sends me a text and she said I need to talk to you. You can’t be at home. So I said okay, I said I’m gonna go run an errand. And I went up the street just parked in a parking lot. And she told me a story. She got back and told her husband and he said, I have to tell you something. He said back in 2017. Joe came to me and asked me for a six figure loan to watch. I said, Man, I can’t do that. But what is going on? Like, are you guys okay, what’s happening? Then he gave him some story about needing to pay a loan back to his employer or something and, and our friend tried to talk to him, he’s like, it’s fine, dude, everything’s fine. And and Joe left. So our friend goes and looks at Joe’s company website and sees him listed as an employee there. And then a few days later, he saw him at his kids school event and said, Hey, is everything okay? It’s like, and Joe at a super nonchalant, like he had never asked for the loan. brushed it off, everything’s fine. What are you talking about? And he went and checked the website again. And Joe was no longer listed as an employee. He never told his wife because he didn’t think it was his place to get involved. And Joe had told him this in confidence. So he was trying to keep the confidence of a friend. But when she came back from the trip and knew this, he’s like, I have to tell you, because I think Carrie needs to know what happened a couple of years ago. So I go home. And I say, Joe, did you lose your job in August of 2017? And he looks at me, he goes, why? I said, Just answer the question. And he looks at me and he says, Yeah. And I said, you got up every morning and went to work. Where were you going? I would just go sit at a coffee shop all day. I said, I was only working part time, our daughter was doing a competitive sport, we were paying for preschool for our son. We went on multiple trips, the money was coming into the account. And that’s when I realized that he had been withdrawing money from my Roth, my 401k. And our children’s 529 college savings plan, he would move it back and forth between five to six different accounts before depositing it in the form of his paycheck into our main account.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  21:06

Carrie tells Joe, he needs to come with her to the bank, so she can verify with her own eyes, how much money is left in their main account. He agrees that they will go together on Friday morning,

Carrie  21:20

I thought there was a pretty large sum of money in this account, because we had made a good chunk of money selling our home before we moved. And that morning, he said, Oh, I can’t go. I have a last second meeting. And I said, it’s it’s not an option. We’re going and we’re going right now. This is more important than any meeting. And he said, Oh, the money’s not in that account anymore. I moved it. I moved it the other day. And, you know, I’ve had my own one and only out of body experience in my life. I looked at him. I remember he was sitting on the couch, and he was tying his boots. And I said, there’s no money anymore. Is there, Joe? And he just kept tying his shoe and barely whatever goes, nope. It’s all gone. And I felt like I was watching myself from above. And I flew across the room and I I slapped him across the face. It’s the only time I’ve ever hit anyone that I slapped him across the face. And I fell to the floor. And I said that was my only way out. How could you? I was hysterical. I called my parents. I was hysterical. And my dad who parents superb ly and a crisis just had to talk to me like a small child, you’re going to get dressed. I’ve looked up this fake, it’s this far around the corner, you’re going to drive there, you’re gonna go open an account, we’re gonna wire you money. And you’re going to call me back, do that, and then call me back. So I did. And then I just kept doing whatever he told me to do next. And then I realize, I’ve got to get out of here. I have nobody in this town. I was across the country from my parents, I had no job. I had no money. And so I called the people we were renting from and said I need to know how to get out of this lease. And she said, sort of lease he he bought this house. And actually we’re getting ready to send you guys an eviction notice because he’s not been paying the mortgage. And I said I’m sorry, what?

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  23:52

Back when they first moved to the area, Carrie had given Joe the financial power of attorney so he could sign the lease. But instead, he used it to buy the house from the company that flipped it. And each month the payment Joe was supposed to send for the mortgage. Well, it wouldn’t go through he would send the check but not date it or sign it or it would be late to top it off. Carrie found out that the mortgage was way way too much money $100,000 More than they could afford.

Carrie  24:24

So here I am. owning a house that we can’t afford. There is nothing in the bank accounts. And I don’t have access to half the other stuff to know if there’s anything anywhere. It was really scary. So I freaked out obviously. And all he would say was I’m so sorry. And I said I want to know where the money went. And were you gambling Do you have an affair to another family? Where did it go? I don’t know. I remember, I was just paying bills, I don’t remember. I thought you’d be mad at me if I got lost my job. He had lost his job earlier in our marriage. And we had made it work. It wasn’t. It’s part of life, jobs come and go. He never gave me the opportunity to go to work full time to support our family. Because I remember he had said, I’m worried about my job. And I’m like, Well, I can start full time they need me, they would love me full time. Just tell me when I’ll go back. Home. No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t want you doing that. I know you want to be home with the kids have time.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  25:37

Carrie wants to run as far and as fast as possible. But she has no money, no resources. So she tries her best to do what she can. The next month in December, she flies out to a job interview back in the south where her family is, and she lines up work there. However, the Midwestern state that they currently live in, requires Carrie to have been there for six months before she can file for divorce.

Carrie  26:06

I got a divorce attorney. And we had everything ready, just waiting for the six month date to be able to file and I just sort of had to hang out and wait. And sleep under the same roof as this man. I remember. I had a backpack that had all the documents I had found. Every everything I gathered everything I knew, and I would not let it out of my sight. If I left the house, the backpack went with me. When I went to for my job interview, I drove it to someone’s house I knew and said I need you to watch this for me for the next few days. If I slept, it was in bed with me. And he remember him saying I’m not gonna go through your stuff. Why are you why are you acting like this? And I said, Are you fucking kidding me? So I was 39 years old. I had a doctorate I was getting ready to get kicked out of the home right lived. I had two children and I was terrified. I was terrified.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  27:38

Back, carry is trying so hard to pick up the pieces after Joe’s laundry list of secrets blows up her entire life. But she isn’t doing it alone.

Carrie  27:51

Some days, I’m still surprised that I am still steady. I was really fortunate that I had my career that I had my family and that I have the most badass frets. It was Christmas time. I had no money to buy my kids presents. My friends sent me gift cards that I still put together Christmas for them. They had no idea it was any different.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  28:20

But even with the presence wrapped and under the tree, there were some things she knew were not going to feel normal for her son and daughter who were only five and nine at the time. They had questions and once again, Carrie needed answers.

Carrie  28:37

When I flew out from my job interview, we just told them I was going to visit a friend for the weekend. We were sleeping in separate rooms. One of the kids had asked and I said oh, one of us is snoring. You know the age old answer. I wanted to wait until they were on their winter break from school. I went and talked to the school counselor I went and told both their teachers that a divorce was getting ready to happen and that the kids and I would likely be moving. I tried to have everything set up for his support. He did not have it. And on their holiday break. We sat them down. He said nothing. He just sat there and rubbed our daughters back. And I did every single last bit of talking. And I just said there are a lot of different families out there. You know how mom has read the books about some families have a mom and a dad. Some families have two moms and some have two dads or some families decide that their family will be healthier if the mom and dad don’t live together anymore. And I said this is what your dad and I have decided and my nine year olds daddy’s girl she understood right away and was pretty hysterical crying. And my five year old was just looking around. And when he saw his sister cry, he started crying. I don’t think he really understood what it meant. But they both, you know, they cried and and she just kept asking why, why. And I said, sometimes adults just can’t make things work and their adult problems, they’re not your problems to have to bear. And we’re gonna be here for you every step of the way. And I did all the talking. And he just sat there, we’re living under the same roof. And he’d say, I have a work event tonight, and he would go out and he would stay out all night. But he would come home before the kids woke up with a dozen doughnuts from the bakery down the street and the data here, and I don’t know what he was doing, who’s with. But he just decided he was gonna start living, you know, the way he wanted to live. As soon as I found out, he’s like, it’s kind of a relief that you know, now.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  31:08

Carrie files for divorce in January of 2020. She and her kids move back to the south so they can be closer to her parents. But this move lands them smack dab in the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic. So Carrie is moving across the country, again, fresh off a messy divorce and fresh out of money, while the world around her is falling apart as this deadly virus spreads. As if all of that wasn’t hard enough, she is also navigating life as a newly single mom. And although she does have full legal custody of the kids, she wants them to have their father in their lives. So in the beginning, she tries co parenting.

Carrie  31:52

I had this idea in my head of oh, I can, we can be one of those, you know, couples that can still have a holiday together for their kids. And you know, but I’ve had to learn, it’s taken me a long time to learn. That’s not possible. He’s still lies to me to this day. Over things that are, you know, it could be a blue mug sitting in front of us. And I would say that mug is blue, and he would say was red. And within five minutes, he’d have me convinced it was red, he’ll lie about anything. It doesn’t matter. There’s no reason for it. It’s just a lie to lie. And so I’ve had to really make peace and know that we’re never going to be that cozy little co family.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  32:32

Today, Carrie and her kids still live in a South while Joe lives up north, a 24 hour drive away from them.

Carrie  32:40

He has the kids in the summer for a period of time, and some holidays, things like that. But I am the one that does the heavy lifting, day to day parenting, get them ready for school, do all of that. And I am also the one that bears their grief. And at the beginning of this, I would say to myself, it is my honor to bear their grief, it is my honor to bear their grief because the amount of anger that is directed towards me, particularly from a teenage girl now, it’s really hard to swallow. You know, dad is the hero. And I am the one that is here. And the kids ask questions now. And I’ve had to navigate how much to tell them. Because lying is something I tell my kids, I can hear anything but I will not tolerate our family lying to each other. There’s nothing that’ll make me more upset than you lying. So I don’t want to lie to them about what happens. But they ask hard questions like the son or my daughter said, Hey, some of my friends said that they have college saving funds to I have a college savings fund. What am I supposed to say? Well, you did. But your dad spent it all. Or you know Why is dad gotta have a new wife and you don’t have any buddy?

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  34:16

Yep, you heard that right. Joe is getting remarried. Can we just like conan for a second on the on the fiance? Does she know about all?

Carrie  34:32

Yes. Yep. I told her You told her because there was a time we had to communicate about something with my children.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  34:41

How did that conversation go?

Carrie  34:43

I thought she was gonna break up with him. They were not engaged yet. And she made it sound like she was gonna leave them. And then the next thing I know, they moved in together. And and now they’re getting married and she’s even said to me The past you’re the one that took his kids away from him. And I said, let’s, you know, no, I kept a roof over his kid’s head, but you do what you need to do. I’ve warned you, I’ve done my job. So I wish them the best. And that’s all I’ll say about that.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  35:20

Even though Carrie should clearly win some sort of award for taking the high road, it is impossible to not acknowledge the sheer unfairness of this entire situation. I remember seeing this old home movie from when I was like, I don’t know, barely five, maybe barely four. And I was whining to my mom about how my brother took one of my toys, and it wasn’t fair. And you hear my mom behind the camera, say in the sweetest voice. No one ever said life was fair, Stephanie. And you know what? She was right. Life is not fair. And Carrie knows this more than anyone. She continues to respond to the hard questions that her ex husband has left behind, because that is the kind of wonderful loving mother that she is. Even when it is gutting to be asked these hard questions, she tries to answer as honestly as possible. But at the same time, she won’t tell them everything, at least not yet. Because they’re still so young. And carrying the burden of that is hard work.

Carrie  36:31

It’s been a difficult path in a lot of ways. And I have to remind myself a lot of the time to stay in my lane. To do what I know I need to do to raise these kids to be the kind of human beings that I know that they’re meant to be and stay in their lane. But it has been a very steep learning curve. I don’t know what it’s like to be that my parents are still happily married. I don’t know what it’s like to be a kid of divorce. And they’re allowed to feel however they need to feel. And whatever help they need, I’m here for but that no one gets to tell them how they feel about this. And that divorce is hard on everyone. And that just like, I won’t understand what they’ve been through. They don’t understand what I’ve been through. But it’s not their job to worry about me. And I just do my best some days, it’s a lot harder. And other days, you know, I’m bitter that I’m the one doing all the work. But I also know that I’m the lucky one. And he’s really missing out.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  37:37

As far as money stuff goes, the challenges Carrie is facing will never really be done. Because Joe has left her with tons of unfinished business that is a mountain of debt and endless unanswered questions. Did you ever find out where the money had gone or what he was spending it on?

Carrie  37:58

Even when I got access to some of the accounts, because I had him sign paper that I could go to the bank and get into his accounts, which I didn’t even know there had been any. I remember having all of the papers sat out in front of me and trying to follow. It looked like a web on likes, you know, one of the crime shows with a yarn, I was trying to get yarn criss crossing, I would say okay, this money came into this account, and then he moved it to this account and moved it to this account, and then to here and then you would lose track of it. And then you’d see that same amount gets deposited into the account that I had access to I use air quotes there since half the time I didn’t. I would have had to have a forensic accountant to really be able to figure it out. And to this day, he still won’t tell me you know, I I had creditors calling me all the time harassing me telling me I’m a horrible person I’ll debts I didn’t know existed. And I, to this day, I’ll say I just want to know it would really help me to know. You know, did you have a gambling problem? Did you make a bad investment? What was it? I don’t remember? I don’t remember. What the fuck? What the fuck is right?

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  39:16

You’re talking about like, hundreds of 1000s of dollars. Correct?

Carrie  39:21

Yeah, you have time was all said and done? Yes. So the bottom line is he’s not willing to tell me and give me that. And so I’ve had to work really hard on saying it doesn’t matter. I have to learn to heal. And part of that healing is knowing that I’ll never know.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  39:40

Oh man. So the money piece of it. I mean, do you still have this hanging over your head? Do you still have to pay some of this money back like where are you financially?

Carrie  39:51

I am in a much better space. When I was going through the divorce. My attorney advised me that I basically had two options we could file police reports. I mean, there was clearly mail fraud at the very least here, identity theft and all those things. But it’d be difficult to prove because a lot of Eddie had my social my username, my password, my electronic signature, or we could write a settlement into my divorce. And at the time, I had decision fatigue, I was so worn down, I said, let’s just do the settlement. So there was a fee, we came up with it. And it didn’t account for all the retirement savings, but the debts that we could find, where we added up a total and said, you have to pay this much a month for this many months. And regardless of whether he declares bankruptcy or whatever, he has to pay it, and went with that. And then I got a notebook. And on every page I wrote, this is this debtor, this is how much I owe them, they’ve offered me to only pay this much back, here’s how much I can pay them back. And I for the for it was a full time job, okay, it’s the 12th of the month, I have to call these people and pay $1,000 To get this debt down. And then I owed my parents a lot of money because they paid for my booth here, they paid for my first and last month’s rent, they and I busted my ass, and I saved and scrimps and did everything I could and I have, I’m in a much better spot, my credit is fine. I was my kids and I moved to the summer to a new home. And let me tell you how amazing it felt when I applied and they credit checked me and I got approved on my own, with no help from anyone. And it’s only been three years and I felt like a million bucks.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  41:44

Amazing.

Carrie  41:46

It felt amazing. And it’s it’s nothing special. It’s just a little house. But I did it by myself. And I manage this house and I manage our family and I am the one that gets them to school and tucks them in and I work full time and I have remained a good friend and I’ve tried to forge back out into the dating world again. And I have done all these things. And yeah, I want to be nice to myself. I feel like a badass.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  42:16

You are a walking bad ass. Okay, I am chill everywhere you are, like you are turning it around. You are turning it around. It is an incredibly redemptive story.

Carrie  42:32

Yeah, and I think that’s why I wanted to tell it, you know, because if you would have told me, the girl I was, you know, when I found all this out that like, it’s going to be okay. I mean, it’s going to be different, it’s never going to look the way you thought it would be, or maybe the way you wanted it to, but you’re going to come out the other side, I wouldn’t have believed you. You know, for the people that are going through this, like there is a way for you to get out. And it’s really scary. But you can you know, if you’re if you’re in this situation, there’s there’s always a way out. And, and life can look different, but it can look good and different might be just what you needed. Totally.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  43:18

I find that in the show, we talk about grief, so much. So many different kinds. And I think, you know, grief, obviously will take your ass down. But it also will give you this perspective that you in no way possibly ever could have had. Without it. It is like so life changing. And this grief you’re describing is so unique. Right? And, but it feels like it sounds like and tastes like and smells like grief.

Carrie  43:54

Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think any divorce is grief, that is less recognized than other types of grief. You know, you lose someone to death. And people support your grieving. When you lose a marriage. It’s looked as as less than but what people who haven’t been through it I don’t think realize is that it’s the death of your past what you thought your future was and your present life this person that was your go to that you shared a bed with that you shared your best and the worst of you is suddenly gone. It felt like a death. And then I felt like not only was I mourning him, but I was also mourning everything that I thought was true. My place in the world my ability to read people my I always thought of myself as an intelligent, independent woman and I realized that I had changed and I had to grieve. You know where at brought me to an agreement for my children, you know, watching them have to navigate the world in a very different way. And, you know, be the kids of a divorced family with, you know, under pretty not good circumstances like I grieved that for them too. And yeah, grief will knock you on your ass.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  45:22

Well, and I think the flip side of it, which is, what are the ways in which you feel like your life is better now than before? Yeah, the flip side, right, right.

Carrie  45:33

Well, I have proven to myself how capable I am. I think I defaulted to letting him do so much. You know, programming the garage door, I can do that. I did it. It seems so stupid. But I did it. I changed out a toilet lid without a man to help me I do the grocery shopping, I pay the bills. I do literally everything. And I work and I’ve really challenging career full time. And I’ve shown myself, I don’t need anyone to do this stuff. For me. I am more than capable. And if I need help, I can ask. And there’s no shame in asking for that help. But I could do a lot more than I thought I could. And that feels amazing. I feel like I gained back my power by saying like, I’m going to learn about this. I’m going to teach myself about finances. I’m going to figure this out. Like I could figure this out. And so I feel like I I’ve worked really hard to learn about different things to take that power back and and not only am I more myself again, but hopefully a better version because of what I’ve been through. And my kids have I don’t know what it’s like to parent them not divorced for this amount of time. But they’re great kids. Do we have our problems? Yes, my daughter is 13. She doesn’t like the fact that I’m breathing someday. Saint Omar, but Right, but we’re getting there. They’re happy. They’re healthy. We we’ve made a community and a life for ourselves. And we did that as a team, the three of us and I’m damn proud of myself, that of them. And there were days where I could not fathom. I didn’t think I’d survive a day. And I want to tell you what I would say to myself everyday if that’s okay, yeah. I was listening to another podcast years ago before this happened. And this woman was talking about the book, The Secret Garden. And in the musical version, there was a point where they sing a song and in the song may say, it’s the storm, not you that’s bound to blow away. And during the midst of this, when things were really bad, there were days where I would have to get up to get the kids on the bus. And I felt like my head weighed a million pounds. And sometimes the only thing that got me through the day was chanting storm. Not you, Storm, not you. And it’s so cheesy, but it it it still has been my mantra to this day. Anything that comes my way. I feel overwhelmed still, but I know I’m not going to go away I would have already and I’m still going to be here. And that’s kind of what I want other people to know too with. When you’re in it feels like you’re never going to live through it. But you will. You’ll find a way.

Alyssa Elliot  00:05

When that reality hit, it was like being dunked in ice water with a brick on top of your head.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  00:11

It’s 2009 Alyssa Elliot is sitting at her desk at work, absolutely drowning in anxiety. The mortgage company has been calling and calling the debts and bills are piling up. And this isn’t like Alyssa, who has always done everything by the book. But that doesn’t matter to the debt collectors, the courts, even the people she’s confiding in, someone has to be held responsible. Even if that person only had the best intentions.

 

Alyssa Elliot  00:44

You say things like I couldn’t have foreseen that this would happen, but like I really couldn’t. At the time I was in my early 20s I was young. I didn’t think that this would be what happens to me.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  01:05

This is Last Day, a show about the moments that change us. I’m your host Stephanie Wittels Wachs. Today, the story of a decision that became $100,000 mistake, and how to make peace with that once you’re finally able to come up for air.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  01:39

Alyssa grew up in Boise, Idaho with her mom, dad and sister and for all of you non Midwesterners,

 

Alyssa Elliot  01:45

That is with an S not a Z biggest pet peeve.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  01:49

Alyssa is childhood in Boise with an S not a , Z, those were the good days, at least in hindsight.

 

Alyssa Elliot  01:56

I had like what I think, or what I thought looking back was really great like early childhood, my parents were pretty cool and pretty creative. And my mom was one of those moms that everybody was jealous of and really loved. And that was like the coolest mom, she would, you know, bring treats to school and be really involved with like activities and crafts and fun stuff like that. And she was part of my girl scouts and you know, just the stuff that moms do when they’re really involved with their kids and it was off.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  02:27

She was like an early Pinterest mom before.

 

Alyssa Elliot  02:30

I think she would have been a front runner in the contest click yeah, for sure. But yeah, like one year for my birthday, she forgot my presents. And we would always go camping for my birthday. And she panicked. We were camping two and a half hours from home in the mountains in north central Idaho. So she went to the gift shop at the little campground. And she found all these little tchotchkes and little Bitsy things, and she scavenged her way through the campground and begged of these random strangers to hide some of these presents admits their belongings. So I get to roam around the campground with these little clues. And then every different campsite I came to had a different tiny present that my mom had thought of and I was so excited by the action and the process of the thing that I didn’t even realize these are like ridiculous and stupid presents, like not things that I would have normally expected for a birthday. But it was like the magic of the thing that she had thought to conceive of in this weird circumstance was the best was so great. So that was kind of my mom in a nutshell was awesome.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  03:37

In many ways, Alissa’s childhood in Idaho was awesome, but it wasn’t carefree. Alyssa is the eldest daughter, and she’s a straight laced as they come. She was the kind of kid who only broke the rules when she wanted to read under the covers at night with a flashlight. And those are the kinds of kids who tend to catch on when the adults around them are having big, scary conversations. As a kid, did you talk about money? Did you talk about finances? Did you have any awareness of that?

 

Alyssa Elliot  04:07

Yeah, I think I had more awareness than I should have had. I had asthma when I was little. And in the 80s, pre ACA, pre existing conditions were exempt from coverage for your health care plan. And so my asthma was never covered. And that meant like a trip to the ER would be exorbitant. And a nebulizer was like, out of the question. Like, there’s no way we could afford it. And inhalers, you know, like 50-60 bucks a pop. And so I was constantly like, fearful of having an asthma attack and being, you know, a problem and I could overhear the conversations about like medical bills and you know, this doctor, this doctor or they want to send her to pulmonologist or an allergy and asthma doc, and we just can’t swing it and there’s no way and if I think I don’t think they intended for me to hear as much of that as I did. But I was very alert. And like, I paid a lot of attention to things that adults said. And so I heard more than I probably should have.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  05:12

Like she said, Alyssa’s parents likely didn’t intend for her to overhear their arguments about her costly health condition. But it was no secret to the kids that their parents fought constantly.

 

Alyssa Elliot  05:25

Money was always like, at the heart of most of the conversations, my dad was in sales, and he had a huge territory of like, six western states. So he would always be on the road during the week, and then home on the weekends. And my mom was a stay at home mom until right about fourth grade. And she’d always baked cakes, baked cookies, made all kinds of stuff from scratch, and it was always perfect and amazing. So my entire life, we’d have these like, elaborate really cute birthday cakes, like Carebears, or Cabbage Patch Kids, you know, and they were always like, decorated, just adorable. And so she wanted to open a bakery, and she figured out how, and my dad was not really a part of that stuff. That was kind of an awkward, like, my mom’s just going to do this on her own kind of thing. And I don’t remember how they scraped up the money to like, make the bakery. I don’t remember how any of that stuff, like worked out but she started this bakery and it was wildly successful from the get go. And that took off in ways that I think neither of them had planned for or prepared for. And so we were kind of like latchkey kids at that point, which wasn’t, I think anticipated from either parent. But my dad was gone, he was working. And my mom was at the bakery.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  06:45

Alyssa’s mom continues to bake her incredible cakes now for paying customers. And the demand is up.

 

Alyssa Elliot  06:53

She had started doing like booking wedding cakes out almost like a year in advance because she was so popular. And her cakes were so good. Everything was from scratch. The frosting was amazing. And so she had booked this cake and it was the most expensive cake she’d done to date, I think it was 2500 bucks, which in the 80s holy shit, like who pays that? I don’t even know even today. I’m like, who are you people but and it had these white chocolate ribbons all around it that she’d had to make from scratch like by hand, you know, she’s like hand forming these ribbons around these like metal dowels and trying to get them to shape just right and everything. So it took her like three days to make this cake, it was unreal. And she was delivering it at this ballroom. And they had just wax the floor and they didn’t have a sign up. And she was carrying the bass, which was like over 50 pounds. It was huge. And she didn’t have anyone helping her. And she went to take a step in the ballroom to start crossing the floor and she like absolute acid over teakettle flipped up in the air. And she hit the ground with the full force like on her lower back. And she saved the cake. There were like two little thumb holes in either side of the base of the cake because she was so frantic about how much money that cake cost, what that would represent if she had to kind of give them a reimbursement or whatever. And also, she was, I think, heavily cognizant of this being someone’s special day and she didn’t want to ruin it, so she was like, oh, shit. So she predicted the cake at all costs and took the hit on her back and ended up severing a fusion that she’d had done a couple years prior in her lower back or lumbar spine. And then additionally, it broke her pelvis. But they didn’t identify that her pelvis was broken until a couple of months after, but she was in exorbitant pain the whole entire time and couldn’t figure out why. And so she went back in and they did I think get an MRI or whatever the hell they do, and they were like, oh, that’s less than ideal. And they had to go in and break it and refix it like reef, set it basically. So for about nine months, she was kind of, you know, at a commission and off her feet, and everybody else was still kind of working at the bakery, like the employees and the business partner that she had found. But they weren’t her. All the recipes were in her head. Like she knew how long to whip the butter before adding the sugar to make it really fluffy, you know, for the frosting. And so people didn’t know what she knew. And they weren’t able to keep up with the demand. She ended up having to sell her share of the bakery. And I don’t remember how much money it ended up being but it was like a pittance. But it was like nothing compared to what she’d put into it. And I remember that being like a sharp right turn of the before her and the after her. I think it like a level of bitterness was exposed that I hadn’t seen before.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  09:45

That bitterness piece that can really, really take a toll and I’m wondering how it kind of seeped into her personality, her parenting her relationship with you. How did that sort of unfold at home?

 

Alyssa Elliot  10:01

Yeah, I think the fights with my parents got a lot more aggressive, they got a lot more violent, they got a lot more frequent. There was this moment where my parents were fighting. And my mom was just absolutely badgering the shit out of my dad. And I was like, screaming at them to stop fighting. And she reached up to like, I don’t know what she was going to do to him. But she ended up climbing the whole side of his face. And it was like a plate open like a bear. Like it looked like a bear had gotten him. And I was like, what in the fuck just happened? I remember being so terrified. And I was so mad at my dad, because he didn’t stop it. Like, he was always taking it from her. And it was always one sided in terms of that level of aggression and like maliciousness, and I could never understand, like, what the hell was going on. And that day, my dad grabbed me by the arm, because I was in the hallway, like kind of causing a scene and trying to get them to stop and seeing if I could distract the action. And he grabbed the keys. And he just ran out the front door. And we left and we went to this little diner, like a half a mile from home, if we could have run into 80 million people that we knew, I don’t know why he picked that place, probably. His adrenaline was just dumping and we sat there and my dad said, you can’t be mad at your mom for this. You can’t be mad at her for this, you don’t know what she’s been through. And I remember just thinking, I don’t care what she’s been through. She doesn’t need to act like that you know, and he told me some stories about my mom’s childhood and what she had lived through and gone through and, and they were horrendous stories. I remember sitting there trying to eat my french toast and being like, it felt it felt like watching a TV show. Like it didn’t feel like this is my mom he’s talking about it felt like some weird like, person off in the distance. And you’re like watching this narrative. And you’re like, wow, that’s, I don’t even know how to take that in. So he was really trying to compensate for like the bullshit of how she was showing up. And I remember being irritated at him for like, excusing it. And part of that was like that innate like little justice seeker. I have like the righteousness like it doesn’t matter. Like it’s not right that she’s like that.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  12:17

Alyssa knew her parents marriage had always been rocky. But this feels like a real turning point because her mom and dad eventually do get a divorce. Meanwhile, her mom sinks deeper into the bitterness of losing her livelihood and suffering from chronic pain. She’s no longer acting like the amazingly capable and attentive mom Alyssa had come to know and love. Everything shifted.

 

Alyssa Elliot  12:41

We were in the car, I can vividly remember the day I can feel the sunlight, I can see where we were on the driveway. Like I know every second of the scene. And I saw a pack of cigarettes on the ground in the car. And I remember being like, why are there cigarettes in the car? Like I have asthma, I can’t be around any smoke of any kind. And so that doesn’t make any sense. And I looked at her and I was like, why are their cigarettes in the car? And she said, what I do with my life is none of your business. And I remember thinking, I’m sorry, what? Like, what just happened? What just happened? Are you essentially admitting that like, those are yours, and I leapt out of the car, I was furious. I was like, I don’t even know who this person is like, what a complete bitch. I was so angry. And that was kind of like, you know, the second of the dominoes to fall and then they started falling much more quickly in sequence. And it was like, here’s the order of things. It’s gone, like what you had before is gone. This is not the mom you thought you had.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  13:43

Alyssa is a […] childhood is shattered, and the pieces feel impossible to pick up. Her mom stops becoming someone to look up to. In fact, she starts morphing into the opposite of everything Alyssa wants to be. For one, her mom starts smoking pot. And to Alyssa this kind of behavior is inconceivable.

 

Alyssa Elliot  14:05

Oh, God, I just remember. I mean, I was a straight laced perfect kid, right? I did not break with asthma. Yeah, I was good. I didn’t break the rules. I you know, followed instructions and paid attention and so yeah, she started smoking pot. And I remember just being like ew, like my friends don’t even smoke pot, like who are you? And this was probably like eighth or ninth grade right about in there. And I was like, I gotta get out of here. And I went to live with my dad.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  14:35

The slow motion unraveling of like Pinterest mom is a lot. That’s a lot to have to acclimate to.

 

Alyssa Elliot  14:48

There was like a switch flipped for sure. And it felt like maybe I just didn’t see what was there the whole time. But I think the narrative that kind of became a red main theme throughout our life at that point was what a victim she was like how everything bad happened to her, like, you know, the bakery was taken from her. She didn’t get what she deserved. So it was like, her way of getting back at life, I guess was just to rebel and do whatever the hell she thought she wanted.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  15:17

Alyssa graduated high school and is determined to get away from her mom. She’s also acutely aware that her mom is moving on to harder drugs, and she’s completely fed up with her behavior. So Melissa moves to Washington State for college and the to stop talking.

 

Alyssa Elliot  15:35

When my graduation came around, my whole family drove up and they brought my mom and she looked decent. She looked okay, so I kind of thought, oh, wow, this is, you know, looking a little better. Well, that next that next summer, she met a man who would become my stepdad. And they had like an a fire and ice kind of relationship, like they were either really good or really bad. And I was accustomed to that with my mom. He had an anger disorder called intermittent explosive disorder. And he was violent and aggressive and really angry, and then he’d be awesome. And he’d be awesome for days, sometimes weeks, and then it would, there’d be an explosion and it was like this, you know, unsteady ground, you never knew what you’re gonna get. And I had stayed back in Washington, I was going to try and make it there. And I couldn’t make it work. I think I felt isolated and alone. And I kind of missed the idea of a community. I didn’t really feel rooted where I was. And so my mom and my stepdad drove up. And they brought me a car.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  16:40

Alyssa’s mom and stepdad, Rick, bring her a 1989 Toyota Camry. Now, Alyssa is considering her situation. She’s lonely in Washington and her mom who seems to be doing better, has literally brought her away out. So she decides to come back to Idaho and move in with them.

 

Alyssa Elliot  17:02

They had found this house in Meridian right outside Boise and it was rent to own. And I was like, Oh my God, how awesome and they pulled up to this house. And I remember just being like, what, like, this is way nicer than I expected you to have, you know, like moved into. It was so cute. It had a little front porch, and a big two car garage, an oversized two car garage, and it had a really cute front yard. I’d gotten a job at a hospital, I was making decent money considering you know, post 911 hardly anything you can, you’d be lucky if you could find a job and I had a college degree. And so I was considered overqualified for most of the things I wanted to apply for. I remember I came home one day and my mom, my stepdad were on the couch. They were side by side, and my stepdad said, we got a proposition for you, kiddo. And I was like, Oh, what’s that? And he’s like, we need your help financing this house. And I was like, what do you mean? And he’s like, well, we can’t get the loan. He’s like, I had a bankruptcy a couple years ago, my credit score is not high enough. I can’t get the loan, but you got a job. You got good credit. You can help us. You just need to cosign. And I was like, okay, I don’t know what any of that means. But I mean, this house is awesome. I loved it, it was beautiful. I was staying there, too it was like we’re all winning. So I did, I co signed the mortgage for my mom, my stepdad and I didn’t think anything of it. I there was no adult presence in my life going like, hey, maybe don’t do that. That might not be a presence.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  18:26

That’s the adult presence.

 

Alyssa Elliot  18:27

Right? Yeah, right I didn’t have that.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  18:30

Meanwhile, Alyssa’s is Mom is once again able to take what she’s gotten and turn it into something amazing. Instead of baking into cupcakes though, her mom and Rick said about renovating this adorable house. They put in hardwood floors, granite countertops, and a new garage door, basically turning it into an HGTV Dream Home.

 

Alyssa Elliot  18:51

They have this weird like corner pantry in the kitchen that was kind of blocking the view from the inside. This was before like open concept floor plans were a thing. And he was like if we take this pantry down, you know it’ll really open up the room. So maybe we take this pantry out and just like put a big island here. And so they did that and they put in granite countertops. Like they put all this work into the house. They painted it, he did a three color color scheme for the paint. There was like beige, this really pretty like ivory and then this neat foresty Green was like the accent color. Everything he’d done was top notch. It looked absolutely incredible, you’d never know they didn’t hire a contractor to do this work and I remember kind of thinking at the time, like how do I get the money to pay for this? Because my stepdad was on disability. My mom is on disability because of all the back stuff that she’d suffered her entire life. And she was never able to work again after the injuries that she sustained from delivering that wedding cake so I thought it was weird, but I didn’t really think anything of it at the time. And I was back in Washington I bought condo, a really cute little condo loved it. And I think it was, like $158,000 or something that is just obscene to think about these days but the problem was when I had gotten a loan for this condo it was it had an adjustable rate mortgage, I had an arm because I had the burden of my parents house hanging on my credit. And I still didn’t fully understand like the ramifications of what that meant but I was assured, like, if you make good payments, you have good payment history. If your parents keep making the payment in in Boise like, you’ll be fine, you’ll be able to refinance this adjustable rate. And when it’s ready, you’ll refinance, you’ll be good to go.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  20:38

To Alyssa, it really feels like all of her hard work has paid off. She checked all the boxes, did well in school, paid for college on her own, and then graduated and got a job, which let her buy her own place. In her mind, all she needs to do is follow the playbook and everything will be fine. Except her playbook. Like really all of ours to be frank didn’t take into account the inconceivable.

 

Alyssa Elliot  21:07

One day I was sitting on the couch in the living room, I was watching TV. And I got a phone call from my mom. And she said Rick’s gone. And I was like what? And she’s like he’s gone. And I’m like, where do you go? And she’s like, I don’t know. I can’t find him. He said he was going to Denny’s to get breakfast and bring it back. And he’s he’s not come back. I don’t know where he is. Maybe he got in a wreck or you know, so I’m trying to think of all these different things, and and so she ends up calling, you know, the hospitals later in the day and is like, do you have, you know, a person like this, she called the State Patrol. She called a bunch of different places trying to figure out like where he might be. But he had taken the car, so she didn’t have a way to like, get around and like go try to find him.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  21:52

You had been living with them. Were they getting along then was it like? I mean, you said he would explode every now and then but.

 

Alyssa Elliot  22:01

There was nothing to give me an indication that they would split the way that they did. Like, you know those hence, you have friends whose relationships are going downhill and you have signs like they say like, oh, he’s being a dick. Like, this is shitty, but like that didn’t happen. So it was kind of like out of the blue. Literally, he just disappeared. He literally left everything. He didn’t even pack a bag. She was on his body. And that’s it, it started to get weird when the next day came, and he wasn’t back and there’d been no word from him. And then the next day came and there was no word from him. And then like about a week, and I remember thinking he’s like, seriously gone, like he has really gone. And I knew that his disability was the bulk of the income because he had some military stuff, and then his disability so that was how they were paying the payment. And I was like, how are you going to be able to pay the mortgage if he’s gone? And my mom was like, well, I’ll figure it out. I’ll get a roommate or something. And I was like, okay, well, you should probably get working on that. Because the payments going to be due before you know it, and you should probably make sure you can pay it. And she’s like, yeah, I will. And I was like Mom, you have to because I have this mortgage up here and it’s going to adjust and I have to be able to refinance this house, I can’t lose it. This is where I live, like you’ve got to, you know, do the right thing. And she was like, okay, I’ll figure something out. And so she would have people come over and she’d be like, no, I can’t live with that person. Oh, that woman was trashy. Nope, I can’t live with her, okay and it was just one story after another about how the people that she kept finding were just unsavory, and I’m unworthy of sharing an abode with her. And I’m thinking, You know what? Desperate times mine just figure it out, get your shit together. And she didn’t, and she missed a payment. And I was the secondary on the loan. And I was like, well, no, it’s my mom, my stepdad. And like he left and like, I’m arguing with reality. Like, I think I knew what was happening, but I didn’t fully understand.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  23:53

At what point like when, when Rick leaves. Do you start to connect? I mean, you use this amazing phrase, which was arguing with reality. But what is the moment where you’re like, Oh, my God, where the floor drops out from underneath you. And you’re thinking, Rick’s leaving didn’t just impact my mom. This is now my issue, my problem.

 

Alyssa Elliot  24:17

I think like the first time my, my phone rang when I was sitting at my desk at work, and it was her mortgage company calling to tell me that the payment was late. I think that was the day where I was like, oh, fuck, you know, and I think it’s funny. Like, I swear, I told the people like, please don’t call me again. I remember just being like, don’t bug me while I’m at work. Like, don’t call me again. Like, oh, that’s so cute. No, they can call you whenever the hell they want they own you, yeah so it was. I think that moment was when I was like, oh shit, this is really real. I think until that first payment had been missed. It kind of felt like there was still some runway, but it was gone. It was gone.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  24:58

And then it must just felt like quicksand.

 

Alyssa Elliot  25:00

It did, it felt like quicksand and ice water and lava and all the shitty things that you can possibly dream up as like torture devices for, you know, to suck you under, it was, I think three or four months later, I got a phone call in the middle of nowhere from a number I did not recognize. And I answered the phone and it was Alyssa? And I was like, yeah, and he goes, I’m real sorry. And I was like, who is this? And he’s like, it’s Rick. And I was like, you better be sorry. Like, you’re, you’re fucking up my life. Like, why would you leave? What did you do? Where are you? Like, when are you coming back. And he was like, I’m not coming back. I can’t deal with your mom anymore. And then he hung up.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  25:54

We’re back, Rick’s phone call is the final nail in the coffin. He’s not coming back. And Alyssa’s mom can’t make the mortgage payments. So everything has fallen squarely on Alyssa’s shoulders.

 

Alyssa Elliot  26:10

I’ve started doing a ton of research to try and figure out like, what are my options? What can I do to get out from under the situation. And I had a friend from high school who became a realtor and I reached out to her and I was like, hey, so there’s this problem. And I explained to her what was happening. And she really kindly and compassionately explained to me like, what a big fucking deal this was, and how this was not going to end well. And she really carefully gave me a picture of what was to come. And she said, but I’ll do it, I’ll take it on, I’ll figure it out, we’ll do a short sale, we’ll make something work. And so she did. I was like, Oh, thank God, like there’s there’s an end in sight, there’s relief.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  26:52

Okay, let me attempt to explain what a short sale is, with the caveat that I am not a realtor, just a lady with a podcast and a lot of feelings who will give this her best shot. So a short sale is when a homeowner who finds themselves in dire straits like Alyssa and her mom decides to sell their home for less than what they owe on the mortgage, the mortgage lender benefits by getting all of the proceeds from the sale. And in turn, they forgive the difference altogether, or the homeowner has to pay what’s leftover, Alyssa has to do the latter. So she is still stuck paying some money. But it’s a way better deal than a straight up foreclosure. And at this point, Alyssa just wants an out. So it’s the best of some not great options.

 

Alyssa Elliot  27:39

We ended up selling the house for I think like $73,000, or something like that it was very low. Considering what the house was worth, I think the house was worth like, over 200 at the time, because they put so much into it and it had appreciated and it was such a good area. I mean, my God, if we had that house to this day, it would probably be worth like close to 600,000 for the location it is and and what it afforded but whatever. So short sale happens, new people take possession of the home, they move in. And I get a notification from the mortgage company as we’re finishing up all the paperwork, that there’s a big discrepancy in the value, because there had been a home equity line of credit attached to the property. And I was like, what is that? No, there wasn’t like, what are you talking about? And that through that process, I discovered that my mom had stolen my identity, used my social security number, and my date of birth and forged my signature and got a home equity line of credit for $75,000. And that was how they afforded the hardwood floors and the granite countertops and the paint and the new garage door. And like all the beautiful things that they did to the house was through the $75,000 loan that I didn’t know they’d acquired. And so I’m thinking the difference between the short sale and what the loan was for originally is this much not very much money, and then I find out oh no add 75,000 to that it is a lot of money and it ended up being well over $100,000 that the mortgage was shorted when the sale happened. And so the mortgage company filed that judgment against me for I think it was like $110,000 something obscene maybe more maybe like 117 and I mean literally like mental blackhole for these details because it was so fucking traumatizing. And I was so spun up with trying to figure out like, how am I going to save where I live? What am I going to do with my condo like I had no idea. And at that like moment in time hashtag 2008, the rate adjusted on my condo, and the payment almost doubled, and my income didn’t double but the payment doubled. And at that same time the short sale had finally been registered and there was literally nothing I could do to refinance my condo. So I was like, okay, I better figure out how to make that work. So I pulled myself up and found a realtor tried to sell it. Nothing, nothing, nothing. We ended up dropping the price to $53,000. And no offers no offers, no one would take it. And it went into full foreclosure. At the time, like I was making my car payment, I was making my credit card payment, like a cell phone payment utilities. And I, I knew like this is a steep cliff. And I don’t understand what’s on the other side of it. But I also remember just being like kind of disassociated from it, because how do you come back from this? What do you even do? Like, what is the next step? It was so terrifying and traumatic. My mom’s mortgage company filed a judgment against me for all that money than I had a full foreclosure on my credit, and I had no choice but to declare bankruptcy. And when that reality hit, it was like being dunked in ice water with a brick on top of your head, like there’s no way to come out. And I thought for sure my life was completely over. And clearly, like my mom is, is gone from my life again, like I was so furious that this circumstance was what was happening. And it it sucked, because I couldn’t talk about it with anyone. Because everyone would be pithy and judgmental with their shitty comments of well, yeah, that’s why you don’t ever use your credit for anyone else. Well, yeah, and that’s why you should never cosign a loan for anyone. Well, yeah, that’s why I mean, it was just this endless refrain of like, You’re a fucking idiot. Why’d you do that to begin with. And that’s not helpful. I mean, no one fully understood that frame of reference of having this awesome mom, that goes downhill, climbs back up, makes it up, gets better, seems like she’s doing okay. And then boom, right back down again. So, I mean, I thought I was doing the right thing, by pulling them up, and helping them be successful homeowners. And I don’t know, I think like you say things like, I couldn’t have foreseen that this would happen. But like, I really couldn’t, at the time I was in my early 20s, I was young, I didn’t think that this would be what happens to me.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  32:21

Listen, we all make mistakes when we’re young, and not a single one of us can predict the future. And really, more than that, whether young or old, we do what we can, at the time, with what we know, fresh out of college, what Alyssa knew was that she couldn’t let a chance at stability, pass her mom by. But now, for all of her good and true intentions, Alyssa is facing bankruptcy. And if you are someone who is not, say, a former US president, but instead an everyday taxpayer, this is a uniquely devastating experience.

 

Alyssa Elliot  33:00

And then from that moment forward, like everything you had to your name that revolved around your social security number is kind of like it either disappears, or, in some cases, like student loans don’t go away. That was a kindness, such a kindness, to get to keep all of those. So I kept my $55,000 in student loan debt. But other than my car, and my student loans, everything else disappeared. So I didn’t have a credit card to my name. Think about like the economic stability that a credit card affords you, like you have the ability to carry that buffer. And even though it’s gonna suck, and you’ll have to pay it back, you still at least know mentally, you’re secure in the knowledge that you’ve got away to carry yourself through a situation that could come up a car repair, something like that, or, you know, a medical bill, in my case, like needing a different inhaler, or whatever, like, how do you pay for this shit? And I had to recognize, what do you do when you have to live without that? And I felt so precariously at risk at all times? Because I’m constantly thinking, oh, my God, what if I need new tires, I have no way to pay for new tires. I had no savings, you’re not allowed to have savings. Because if you had savings, you needed to put it towards your debts. And so I had no backing for anything. Should anything pop up that I needed to like financially cover. I think my credit score dropped to 200. After the bankruptcy, it might even be lower than that. I mean, it was like, what is that? Is that a thing? How does that work? So I got approved for this unsecured like credit card. And the interest rate, I think I swear to God, it was like 35.8%. So if you use it like Jesus, a third of what you just spend is your next like interest bomb. So it was miserable but slowly, I had to incrementally kind of like find those little bitty footholds that could help me secure a little bit more credit bit by bit at a time. So I would use that ought to like buy gum. And then I would make the payment. And then like, just for the sake of like, I’m making payments, look at my payment history, I’m a good person. And it really was that I’m a good person that kind of pulled me through because I felt like such a shitty person for having to live like this and having to be this burden on society.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  35:25

When you’re in the deep suck, right, when something is pulling you down, but you still have to get up and go to work and like function in the world, especially if it’s a financial issue, like you can’t lose your job at this point. How are you managing, keeping on with your life?

 

Alyssa Elliot  35:43

I remember just an intense feeling of isolation, and feeling like completely alone, completely terrified. Feeling like showing up to work every day, I had to kind of turn that part of my brain off. Because I could feel like I could feel myself in meetings just like vibrating with anxiety and in fear and stress and like, waiting for my phone to ring, knowing it was going to be the mortgage company again, and just thinking, what do I do next? What do I do next? And there was this like, you know, survival instinct that kind of kicks in at the end of the day where it’s like, you just have to put one foot in front of the other. But it wasn’t cognizant of that. Because it didn’t feel like there was any other choice. Like, I just felt like it was existing just to exist, it didn’t feel like I had, you know, a purpose, or a thing that was within my control and my power to do or to fix about it.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  36:38

Do you remember like conversations with your mom at this time? Like, what? How were you talking to her? Were you just like, you are ruining my life? Like, were you keeping it at bay? Like what was what how?

 

Alyssa Elliot  36:50

Though, I was very clear that she was ruining my life. Yeah, I was like, abundantly clear with her that this is like the last straw like this is going to be it like you figure out how to fix this or like we’re done. And she just went straight back to that victim mode that my dad had warned me about, you know, things that happen to her when she was younger, are really bad. And you know, she can’t help the way she is. And he was, you know, he kind of would make excuses for her even then, about, you know, she’s not doing this to hurt you. She’s not doing this on purpose. She doesn’t know any better. She doesn’t have any, you know, skills to pull herself out of the slump. And I’m like, Oh, my God, where are you making excuses for her. But I think he was given visibility to like some of the past trauma that I was oblivious to. And so I’m hearing about it second and third hand and it it’s not registering with me because I’m an adult, I’m making choices. I’m doing things I’m taking care of myself, I went to school, I got student loans, I did this all on my own, I have not a penny of help from my family to make that work. And so I just remember thinking, if I can do it, like, what’s your excuse? Like you’re an adult, you could get your shit together. If you choose to you’re at this point, you’re choosing not to get your shit together. And I don’t respect that. And it was really, really hard for me to just not be a complete see you next Tuesday. Every time I talk to her because yeah, I just, I was so angry. And so mad.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  36:55

This is interesting, Alyssa, like, now I’m going to arm share you. The whole crux of your mom’s spiral downward was this bitterness that took hold, right? Because something happened out of her control. And here, you’re telling me this thing happens out of your control. And now you have to it’s like, literally, I did not do anything. They left the floor waxed and didn’t put up a sign. I co signed this thing, Rick leaves and now I’m fucked, right? Like, how do you not let bitterness start to color your heart and soul? I mean, it’s such a weird parallel story in a way.

 

Alyssa Elliot  39:08

Those parallels ate me alive, and I saw them objectively, I could see them. And I was like, curious, like, what a bizarre similarity to share with her, this person who I resent so much. And I remember thinking, I can’t do this to another human being I can’t do this. I can’t be like this to someone. And being so worried that because those parallels were so stark, that I would repeat exactly what she did to me if I had kids myself. And I knew like I can’t do it was never a conscious thought, like, I want to have a family or I don’t want to have a family, it was more just like that’s a thing that you do. And it’s what comes next and it’s like phased and I was confident that if I had kids, I would be just like she was was to me, and I wanted nothing to do with that. I couldn’t hold space for the idea that I would inflict on someone else what she had inflicted on me. And I didn’t have faith in my own ability to not fall right down that hole.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  40:16

Wow.

 

Alyssa Elliot  40:16

So I made the choice. And now it’s too late. And I kind of think about that sometimes about how, you know, are you really destined to repeat the same shit that happened to you? And it’s like, I watched it. I was a part of it. I watched it, I participated. So I don’t know, it keeps me up at night, sometimes.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  40:38

I know, it’s big stuff. Did you recognize what you were sensing what you were feeling as bitterness, and resentment? Like, could you identify like, this feeling that that I’m having towards her is potentially disruptive? I mean, how did you not allow that to crystallize into the same bitterness that really destroyed your mom?

 

Alyssa Elliot  41:07

I think it did for a long time. I think it kind of took root and it. It was like, omnipresent, like, you know, bitterness and anxiety and frustration and fear. And it instilled in me this like chronic fear of like economic instability, and this chronic fear of, you know, if you miss a payment, then everything falls to shit in two seconds, so I’m like, hyper vigilant about financial things that most people don’t think twice about and aren’t concerned with and that has, you know, colored and peppered in my life in terms of like jobs where I’m miserable, like, I’ll stay, I’ll tough it out. I’ll try to be I’ll try to be a hero. I hate this place but I have to have a job, I have to have an income. I was that person. I was that bitter, I was like, I felt myself becoming like her. And I couldn’t handle it, I couldn’t take it, I mean, I had to get to a point where it was like you made choices. You signed that paperwork, you didn’t research in advance. And there’s this really fine line between like, holding yourself accountable and having compassion for the fact that you didn’t know any better, I didn’t know. So I’m like a chronic shudder. I’ll always like should myself to death. And that’s one of the things we’re working on, currently in therapy is don’t say that anymore. That’s looking in the past. And it’s thinking of things and wishing you could do them differently. It’s arguing with reality again, you can’t fix that part. You can only be where you are, which is right here right now. And that’s what you have to do is focus on that.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  42:41

We’re back, the bankruptcy and everything else left Alyssa with a deep sense of unease around all things related to money. And therapy has helped with that. But so has meeting the person who has become her rock through it all. Here’s what I need to know. Where did you meet this wonderful husband? What is the love story? Give me the story.

 

Alyssa Elliot  43:22

Oh my gosh, sorry. It’s borderline, it’s embarrassing. It’s I want to hear so we met during the peak of the pandemic. And I was due to my Asmar, very COVID freaked like absolutely panicked at every moment like yeah, another thing to be like hyper vigilant, scared about it was like groceries delivered or pickup never go in a store, like you’re not going to get new clothes ever again, like you just better deal with what you have.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  43:51

It’s while Alyssa is on lockdown, and furloughed, a COVID double whammy that she decides now is the time to get back into dating. She has been working on herself and honestly, there’s not much else to do at the moment. So she’s swiping through the apps when she comes across his profile. And while he does have the quintessential man holding a fish photo, everything else is giving green flags. In fact, he seems like he’s exactly what Alyssa is looking for. So they start chatting and he asks her out on a date.

 

Alyssa Elliot  44:25

So we met at a Starbucks and sat outside, six feet apart. And in the worst air quality ever, it was literally orange. The air was orange, it looked poopy, it was gross. And we sat there and we talked for hours. And the next thing I know he goes oh shit, and I was like, what? And he goes, I’m late for a Zoom meeting, I have to go, and he jumps on his phone and he starts running back to his car and he comes back and he grabs me by the arm and he’s like, come on, come on. I’m parked over here and I was like, okay, I don’t know what you think you’re doing. Like, I’m not gonna be this close to you. And we get back to his car and he’s like, I’m gonna give you a hug, and it’s going to be okay. And if that doesn’t sum that man up, I don’t know what does because it was like, devil may care, I’m going to hug you. It’ll be fine, we’re not going to die, everything will be okay. And he’s been my everything will be okay ever since

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  45:17

Oh, love this story. Oh, he’s exactly what you needed.

 

Alyssa Elliot  45:24

He literally is. And at the same time, like, I think it’s a blessing and a curse because he can’t understand the depth of this like trauma. And he has such an adorable obliviousness to like how fucking shitty the world can be that it’s sometimes like, I feel like I need to pull him under just so that he can experience what it feels like. And no, this is what it looks like from my side of the fence. But he refuses, he won’t be he won’t be pulled. He has relentless perpetual optimism.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  45:57

As a person who also leads with anxiety, and is married to someone who does not I completely get this. Oh my goodness, do I get this. And again, from personal experience, what a hashtag blessing, this kind of opposites attract magic this is I have just said countless times how much this person that I am married to has saved my soul, my life, my heart. So together with her husband, Alyssa has been able to build a new life for herself a new reality where money and debt are no longer the scary monster underneath the bed.

 

Alyssa Elliot  46:38

So in spite of that bankruptcy, I really did bust my ass to figure out how to get around and like how to make a life for myself and how to make financial decisions that would set me up in a way that was better than what I’d had before. And so in 2014, I found a house that was an absolutely unbelievable deal. And I didn’t think there was any way I’d be able to get a loan for it but I struggled through the process and and made it work. And we combined like I see our income on paper and I’m like, oh, like what, how is this real life? Like what is going on? But it’s like, it doesn’t feel like that because I still have these mental constraints in my mind. And so I struggle with, you know, like, just making a big decision about like, going somewhere or like going on vacation. But like, we’re fine, we’re not.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  47:32

You’re you’re still arguing with reality?

 

Alyssa Elliot  47:34

I am, absolutely, yeah.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  47:36

That’s a positive, now.

 

Alyssa Elliot  47:38

I don’t trust that bitch. I know she’s gonna come for me. And I have to.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  47:43

Sneaky bitch. And she’s come in and you better watch out.

 

Alyssa Elliot  47:47

Yeah, I get it.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  47:50

And when did the bankruptcy lift? What was the date?

 

Alyssa Elliot  47:55

It was 2020, and it was in November, I think November, December. And I remember because my now husband was sitting on the couch. And I got an email from Credit Karma. And it said, Congratulations, your scores increased. And I was like, well, that’s like a weird, like, what non sequitur kind of, you know, timing for your credit score to go up. So whatever, I opened the email, I log in, and I scroll down. And there’s always like the section where it’s like, here’s your green part, the good part, here’s your positive part, here’s your yellow part, yellow was always like your balances too high. We’ll think student loans, like my balance is always going to look too high but and then you scroll down to the bottom where the red is. And it’s like anything that’s delinquent or deficient and the bankruptcy had always been there. And so I like scroll scrolls, there’s no red. There was like, no red spot anymore on my Credit Karma profile. And I like screamed, and he was like, what is wrong? And I was like, oh, my God, oh, my God, look, and I like held the phone up to him. And he was like, what is that? And I was like, it’s gone. And he was like, I don’t know what’s gone. And I’m like, the bankruptcy is gone. Like, and it just felt like I like I’m almost crying because the moment that lifted, I was like, oh my god, new life. This is like a literal, new life. Like, I don’t have to see it anymore. I don’t have to feel it anymore. I don’t have to be shamed anymore. Holy fuck, I’m free, like, I’m free. Like, I’m done with this thing. It’s gone. And yet the remnants of the fear that instilled in me are still there to this day, and they still grind my husband.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  49:35

What do you I’d love to just dig into like, the parent thing. You sort of talked about it earlier, you know that you wonder if maybe you were wrong about that choice, and how do you sort of grapple with that? And, you know, I mean, I’m also one of certain age I understand like, I understand biology feasibility goes downhill. Yeah, I get that but how do you you know, it’s too late, you know, for another kind of way to become a parent or anything like that.

 

Alyssa Elliot  50:04

Oh, that’s so interesting. I don’t think I made space to consider that. I just assumed like the biological train has left the station. And it’s long gone. I think seeing how much of the trauma that was inflicted upon my mom was then inflicted upon me, that I then inflicted upon me and people around me, I just still really don’t have the confidence and belief that I wouldn’t do the same thing. And so I feel like, you know, it’s a kindness to the rest of the world to not bring that shit forward and carry it into a different generation but I think, well, he has a daughter and she’s amazing. I mean, I still kind of just feel like I’m practicing. Like, I don’t feel like a stepmom. I feel like we’re just buds. I mean, I cuz I’m like, hyper vigilant with my stepchild. And my husband’s like, we’re good, she can we can afford those Nikes, like, we don’t need to scrimp, like, she’s gonna be okay, and to my mind, I’m just like, Oh, my God, so spoiled, so entitled, you know, so much access to these things that I never had, and I had to struggle for and there’s bitterness there that comes in, and then I’m like, Oh, my God, don’t be like her. Don’t, don’t be like her. So there’s a perpetual like comparison that kind of goes on in the back of your mind where you’re like, oh, but that thought is reflective of this thing, and don’t don’t bring that in to the picture but.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  51:34

Yeah, I mean, all totally reasonable things that your brain is telling you. And also, I bet that your mom didn’t really do a ton of therapy. I’m just assuming.

 

Alyssa Elliot  51:47

Ever never, never, never. No yeah, no.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  51:51

I mean, yes, all of what you’re saying is true. And also, you are actively changing patterns. I know you’re probably not going to fully hear me but, but maybe you’ll listen back and hear me that you are you are changing it. You are stopping the future generations and the trauma because you’re dealing with your shit, which is a thing that she didn’t do. You have to stop arguing with reality. No, Alyssa, stop arguing with reality. Listen, I will record a voice memo for you. That says Alyssa stop arguing with reality. And then you can play it whenever you feel like you’re spiraling and then you can record one for me.

 

Alyssa Elliot  52:41

You better actually do that now because.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  52:43

I’m going to I’m a man of my word, okay?

 

Alyssa Elliot  52:46

I need it, I do need it. We gotta be there for each other.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  52:53

Alyssa, this is your friend Stephanie. I am here to tell you to stop arguing with reality. Stop arguing with reality. You are safe. You are good. The sidewalk isn’t opening up. There’s no quick stand. You’re all good. Stop arguing with reality, bye.

 

Alyssa Elliot  53:19

Instead of arguing with reality, Stephanie, I will harken back to Harris’s comedic roots and the improv principle of Yes, and and I will say yes and you cannot fight reality, you cannot argue with reality, because reality will always win that war. And the sooner you can learn that lesson and let go of the argument, and the need to be right. And the justification and the vindication of one upping reality, which you can never do. You just need to let it go. You need to let it go. And what has happened is done can’t be undone. And that is reality. So how you navigate the intricacies of that new reality is really what makes or breaks you. And I think that’s the biggest lesson and takeaway I’ve had in this experience.

Sarah Silverman  00:15

Hi everybody, it’s your old pal Sarah. I was in the past few months has been a lot of press, a lot of gowns, a lot of things. And I was in a gown. So ridiculous. And I had to wear Spanx under it, not for shapewear reasons. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. But I had to because of thyroid because it was a tight dress. And when I can’t wear a tight, you know, skirt without like, shorts or something because I get thigh rub and it’s real. It like burns like fire. So I was wearing these Spanx, and then they to pee. There’s a slit in the Spanx that up through a hole, right. And I just thought it would be interesting to mention, because when you’re doing it, so I’m like basically holding a gown in my arms. And now kind of have to move it to one arm, like hold everything. And then open up this p whole envelope thing at my crotch. And then I have to have a conversation with myself. Because it feels like you’re peeing with pants on. And your body’s like, no. And I’m like, no trust me. And my body’s like, no there’s pants on. And I go, no, just relax trust me, there’s an opening. And I have to relax and I have to coax my urine out. That’s a lot going on.

 

Amy  01:57

I have a question. ask you about that.

 

Sarah Silverman  01:59

Okay, go on.

 

Amy  02:00

When you because I’ve never been able to do that. Like, I feel like it still gets everywhere. Like, did you have a clean pee?

 

Sarah Silverman  02:09

Shockingly, I did because usually my pee comes from I don’t know exactly where but I know at least three to four different places.

 

Amy  02:16

Because my fear with that is like up and then like you’re just sitting with a wet crotch the rest of the night.

 

Sarah Silverman  02:22

Yeah, like sometimes I pee one solid stream. And sometimes it’s like, sprinklers. It’s literally like, am I watering grass in a nearby area? Totally like, yeah. I mean, does that mean there’s because usually if you turn on your faucet and it goes different places, there’s like a clog somewhere that’s like pushing it. So is there a clog in my urethra?

 

Amy  02:47

Well, I’m sure this is a clinical reason, but it’s probably because your labia is like stuck together and it’s just bouncing.

 

Sarah Silverman  02:54

Oh my god, wait. So if I pull open, my vulva, my labia majora, open that’s the sound it makes. It should be a single stream. But uh, you know if you’re I know what you mean when your lips are kind of sealed from like this. Like the I can picture like pee coming in almost like going straight to the back before like opening up. She’s dying. We have fun here at the Sarah Silverman podcast.

 

Amy  03:30

The moral is it’s so much easier to pee when you’re a man it is period.

 

Sarah Silverman  03:35

And you know, I remember years ago, I bought something online that was that you could stand up and pee for women. It was like, like a cup that you put over your vulva and then it comes out like basically like a makeshift penis. And you can stand in pee, and I used it, I remember I was at Jessica’s friend’s house. We were watching the oddly like the man show, season something Premiere or whatever. I don’t know why I remember that. And I go, oh, I’m gonna use my standing pee thing. And I used it, and it worked. But it made me feel so weird. Like I was just by myself, you know, maybe just gotta look to little.

 

Amy  04:22

Is it like a funnel?

 

Sarah Silverman  04:23

It’s like a funnel basically, it’s a funnel. And you’d think oh, great. Gonna have it in cars gonna have it. I’m gonna have it for you know, whatever, it’s like if you go to a concert if you go to, because guys don’t realize like when you have to sit, and you’re like, it’s fun to go to a dingy dive bar until you’re a woman and you have to pee. It’s like a whole process.

 

Amy  04:44

I’m a two seat cover kind of girl over here.

 

Sarah Silverman  04:47

Needless to say, we I think even the audience knows this.

 

Amy  04:51

Which is why, Chicago O’Hare Airport is the best place so good to be.

 

Sarah Silverman  04:56

That’s the one where you press the button and it it’s a brand new like, covered in a bag.

 

Amy  05:02

Yes.

 

Sarah Silverman  05:02

It’s why don’t they do that everywhere? Why is it every airport this way?

 

Amy  05:07

But then I also know they say like seat seats are like the cleanest?

 

Sarah Silverman  05:11

Yes, the seats I sit down like I just sat down on the seat here, it’s immaculate.

 

Amy  05:16

Yeah, that’s not ever gonna be me.

 

Sarah Silverman  05:18

Yeah, I know. But like tushy cheeks aren’t dirty.

 

Amy  05:22

I know, but that’s that’s yours. I mean, we could probably make an argument that tushy cheeks are incredibly dirty, depending on how well someone’s wiping.

 

Sarah Silverman  05:33

Oh, god, yeah, if you shit it on your ass cheeks, your there’s you’ve got more problems. I’m guessing, there’s no way your only problem in life is you smear shit on your ass cheeks when you wipe God. Anyway, let’s take some calls.

 

Kelly  06:11

Hi, Sarah, this is Kelly and I was hoping to ask you your opinion on long term goals. I am a small business owner, 44 years old. And I wanted to know how you approach long term goals. Because to me, they’re kind of moot because we’re not in control of everything so I look to the future. I know, like by 64, I would want to sell my business or retire. It’s like 20 years. But then I think about like all the stuff that can happen and 20 years, especially with how unstable everything is right now. So I struggle with developing those long term goals. And then I even struggle with the short term goals to get me to that long term goal, if that makes any sense. Yeah, I just wanted to get your opinion on that. And see how you as a business owner and media personality and fantastic person all around if you have any advice for that, because you have great advice, and thank you so much for all your wonderful entertaining, comedy and advice. It is something that I look forward to every Thursday morning when I’m walking my dog, Biscuit. So thanks so much, and hope to hear from you soon.

 

Sarah Silverman  07:39

Hi Biscuit, you gonna walk? You gonna walk? Hey, biscuit. I just want you to play that for Biscuit. I wouldn’t say I’m goalless. But I always struggle with this because they never think about like, I want to do this in the next five years or I want to […] but I mean, I think because I’ve really come to a place where I fully understand and accept that I’ve never been able to predict the future and will never be able to predict the future so that helps me with anxiety, you know, just not trying to predict the future not trying to worry, tell myself horror stories about how that’s going to unfold because we just never know, we’ve never been able to know, you’ve never been able to predict anything your life. And neither have I. But in terms of long term goals, I mean things that I’ve said to friends, you know, who asked, I would say, make a plan, like you have 20 more years of your business and then retire, you’re making a long term goal. And then you follow that plan, follow that plan until it no longer serves you if you know there’s gonna, it’s either going to, you’re going to see it through through fruition and everything will go as planned, and more likely other things will happen, life will happen that will take you in a different direction and you’ll make a new plan. You know, I mean, goals are great, but it’s of course the road getting to those goals, that is the stuff of life, you have to hopefully enjoy that stuff. You know, because the goal either comes or doesn’t, you know, but the road get going there should be your joy, you know, obviously, like, maybe your joy isn’t working at all, you know, is not having a job or not having a business but you need to, you know, also being responsible for your happiness includes, you know, taking care of yourself financially so obviously it’s a mix of all those things. But um, you know, you got a long term goal. You have a plan to get there and follow that plan unless and until it doesn’t serve you anymore and then you make a new one. I don’t know what else? What other advice I can give along that but it sounds like you’re you’re doing great. But you know, I mean, not fulfilling a goal isn’t necessarily failure and failure isn’t even necessarily bad. So control what you can control and be on the edge of your seat for the rest of it. Good luck, what else?

 

Kelly  10:25

I Sarah, what would be your favorite deep cut of yours? Like someone a fan passes you on the street? And they say, oh my god, I loved you in what’s the thing someone could say they saw and loved you and or like heard you in or knew that you were involved with that would make you most jazzed about that fun interaction?

 

Sarah Silverman  10:54

Well, it’s, you know, again, I like that I do odd jobs, and it’s just funny. The way people know me like there are certain people that know me from Star Trek Voyager. And then there are people that only know me from Howard Stern. And then there are people that know me from like, Monk. And then there are people that are like, I was at Canter’s the other day, and the waitress goes, and I counters it’s like, I love counters all the waitresses are like, waitress all the servers sorry, are like 78 you know? But she goes, are you who you are? Are you who I think you are? And I go I maybe she goes, where are you the one from Marry Me? I was like, oh, yeah, I was in that movie. I guess I was like a friend and then movie. There are also people who know me, there are people just know me from stand up. So they just go oh, she’s really dirty, or she’s really blue. And then there’s people who know me, like I said from like, Monk, and they go, Oh, this is the one from Monk will go see her live and then they’re horrified. You know, there’s also people who who will reference. This is a deep cut is the way of the gun, which is a movie that I’m in just the first scene before the credits. And my character’s name, which I didn’t know until I saw it. And they it says just as raving bitch. But I get beat up by a lovely Ryan Philippi. And it’s a really dark, great movie. I think it’s Christopher McQuarrie, his first movie that he directed, but um, that was one of the three times I was punched in the face, because the other ones were more on purpose. But Ryan beats me up and we of course, you know, practice and we’re taught how to do it and everything. And I know, this sounds like a you know, I don’t mean to blame myself, but I think I’m I maybe I leaned in or something, whatever. But he fully connected, knocked to me off my feet. By the time I opened my eyes, I probably would have cried. But um, he was already crying. I think I’ve already told the story. So I was immediately like, it’s okay. He felt awful but it was cool. I had a huge like black and blue egg on my jaw. And that I believe that was the tape they used. And if not, they actually use the sound from it cracking my job because you can hear it. But that’s a good one. That’s a deep cut for sure.

 

Emily  13:52

Hi, Sarah, my name is Emily. I nine years old. And I really want to be an actor. My mom doesn’t know if he wants me to do it. Because he said actor kids are spoiled brats. My question is, do you ever work with kids? And it’s my mom, right?

 

Sarah Silverman  14:10

Oh, this is so hard. I don’t know how to answer this Emily because I was you at your age. Oh, I just wanted to be an actor, I wanted to be an actress, I wanted to be musicals, I wanted to be all these things. And I was so mad at my mom. She only let me be in school plays but you know what I was in school plays and it panned out great. I’m reading a diary entry. I kept a diary a meticulous diary. But like when I was like 12 and 13 so it’s not like the deepest shit but it’s you know, and one is like, mom will let me sign up for […] on which was like child models or whatever, just pay this, you know fee and we’ll get you or kids into modeling or whatever and of course, my mom was like, That’s bullshit, and you’re not doing it no. I wrote my diary because I knew someone would read it someday and know how abusive she was. Mom won’t let me do […] on. But um, you know, I did school plays, and it was awesome. And I was so into it, and I took an acting class. And there’s lots of stuff you can do at 9 and 10 and 11. You know, you could do that local plays, community theater, school plays. And I think your mom’s probably right in it seems like, for ever from now, before you are, you know, 18 and can make your own decisions or whatever it is, childhood takes forever, because, like, the first seven years of your life is your whole life. But like, to me seven years ago was like, oh, yeah, seven years ago, it was like, I was a comedian, I was doing that, you know, it was like, nothing ago. As you get older, life gets shorter. So I understand like, it feels like forever. But, you know, you know what I would do? I would be in my room and I would read monologues and I would, you know, I would do Emily, not you, but Emily, the character Emily and in our town, and she has a big monologue in the third act, and I would read it in my room, and I would, you know, I’d make stuff up with my friends. And you don’t have to be an earner, you don’t have to be making a living at nine. And you know, one thing I do disagree with your mom, is that these kids are spoiled brats. They might seem like spoiled brats, they’re children, working, like working a job like adults. It’s long hours, it seems very glamorous and fun. And because the only part that you see is the fun part. But it’s long and boring. And you’re not with your friends. And some kids thrive. Some kids thrive and then hit a real hard wall. You know, you’ll be right for and to answer your question. I do work with kids and I have worked with kids and I’m working with kids on this musical the bed wetter because it stars a 10 year old me. And boy, the rejection these kids go through is on another level. And a lot of kids it affects them in a negative way. Some kids thrive and you know, a they grow up to be Jodie Foster, they grew up to be Ron Howard or they grew up to be Selena Gomez. But um, a lot really don’t make it out well, you know, and to have like a real childhood to base the rest of your acting career on to actually have lived experience that isn’t on a film set or a TV set. You don’t want to hear it now and it doesn’t seem real now but they promise it will be worth it. God I couldn’t wait. I could not wait to be an adult and get to be an actor. And even then you don’t necessarily get to be an actor. I got lucky I was a stand up I you know, but that said I will say there are these New York kids, you know, that are Broadway veterans and they you know, the young woman who played me in the Off Broadway Run, Zoe Glick was beyond brilliant. I mean, she was like a tiny Meryl Streep. She didn’t she wasn’t naturally like a little me. She built this character. from the inside out. I watched it happen. And it was mind blowing. This kid is going to be have whatever career she wants, but we couldn’t use her anymore. For the crime of growing, she’s like 14, 15 now. And it was heartbreaking. Because I would have had her forever if I could. But the part is for a little kid. And what happens is, she aged out. Now she’ll age into other roles. She’ll play teenagers and she’ll play you know, older kids. But I can’t imagine what that’s like to she carried this show, this musical. It was all on her shoulders and she was absolutely brilliant. Brilliant and she grew out of it. She didn’t do anything wrong, she did everything right. I don’t know what the right thing is I, you know, I want to support you beat you. Listen, no one’s keeping you from being an artist. No one’s keeping you from performing monologues at dinner, or working on your craft or taking acting lessons or being in local plays. That’s what I did. And if you care about the craft, and it’s not just like, I want to be famous, which is not a craft, then you’ll love doing it. You know, doesn’t matter if the audience is five people or 5 million people. It’s about the craft of acting. And that’s what you are passionate about, right? There’s so much to learn. I mean, part of learning, acting is watching people, or, or listening into the table next to you at a restaurant or on the bus. You know, listening to conversations and thinking, this is real life. And as an actor, I want to capture what that is, I want to really be able to show what real life looks like you know, and study people and watch a million movies, and find out what kind of acting is interesting to you and watch different actors and how they play different roles. There’s so much to do in the next nine years for you to prepare yourself. Live life, observe people and have experiences, you know, if you can be in a local play or your school, play, do it all. But all of it feeds into your future. It’s all preparation. It’s all the stuff you draw on. You only have one childhood. Everything that’s happening right now in your life is the stuff you’re going to be drawing from as an actor. So you’ve already started, and your mom is probably doing the right thing. And I know you won’t understand it now. But you will, alright, what else?

 

Mark  22:23

Hey, Sarah, is your friend Mark, longtime fans love your comedy. I think we’re getting better every year. Please don’t ever stop.

 

Sarah Silverman  22:31

Thanks, Mark.

 

Mark  22:31

Just listened to your recent podcast with the call from the listener who’s having trouble with gas as a result of a botched surgery some 47 years ago. And yeah, that’s a tricky one. But at the end of your little segment on this, you said I’m sure my listeners will be calling in and well, I’m one of them.

 

Sarah Silverman  22:53

Oh, good.

 

Mark  22:53

I googled the problem and found a solution at least a partial solution. And that is a product called tootles TOOTLES thought it was a funny name. And I knew it would resonate with you […] it is underwear both for men and women that has a charcoal filter built into the back. I don’t think it’ll handle the noise aspect. But it should certainly address the smell. So if she could manage to adjust her rump in a way to minimize the vibration, then tootles should take care of the rest. I hope this helps love you.

 

Sarah Silverman  23:34

You know, I was sent a link to charcoal underwear by Jimmy Kimmel years ago and he’s like, dude, you should get this first of all, I don’t pass much gas and if I do, it never smells. If it does, it’s maybe because I’m like really sick or something like but it doesn’t, you know, but anyway, not that there’s anything wrong with that. But that was always like a thing with him and me he would anyway that’s ridiculous. I don’t do that. But um I so I am a little bit familiar with her charcoal underwear, it doesn’t muffle any sound. It’s just that the smelly air passes through it and the charcoal like cleans the smell or something. That’s not the technical answer, obviously. Anyway, thanks Mark, Tootles underwear. I don’t know if it’s, she didn’t mention it smelling but that’s definitely a good to know. All right, what else?

I Sarah, my name is John and I’m calling I just listened to your episode being girlfriend roof, roof feed, and I was very title running to the caller who was having what’s called fecal incontinence due to an accident and the seven days. It’s very common and it’s horrible that she has to think endure this alone, I too had the same problem due to radiation from lymphoma located in my lower region. I was put in touch with a colorectal doctor and he did something called a neuromodulation stimulator. And what it’s doing is it retrained, think of like those nerves, it’s the sacral nerve. And when the sacral nerve is damaged, think of it like a plant that is frozen at winter and it just dies back and when it gets to a certain level of dying back, it no longer works and you develop those type of symptoms. But the neuro modulator stimulator go stimulator is a surgically implanted device very similar to like a pacemaker for your heart. It’s a pacemaker for your poop, and it stimulates the sacral nerves, and I had 100% success with it and now I go about life not looking for a bathroom or.

 

Sarah Silverman  26:05

We should sacral nerves stimulator wonder if that’s covered by insurance, it certainly shouldn’t be for her. Sacral nerve stimulation is covered for the treatment of urinary urge incontinence urgency frequency syndrome and urinary retention. No but oh and fecal incontinence, incontinence? Is it covered by insurance? For ongoing therapy, the cost of the sacral nerve stimulation surgical implant was $22,970. Well, we should let her know about it. Maybe her insurance covers it. God, insurance, this whole racket of health care Gosh, darn it. I don’t want to get into it but anyway, thank you, John, for calling in. Let’s pass that information on. We have another one about this passing gas. Let’s see.

 

Zoey  27:05

Hey, Sarah, my name is Zoey. I first time caller. I just love and appreciate you so much. I have so many things to say. But specifically, I just listened to the episode about the lady who has you know, unintentional farts, and it sounds like.

 

Sarah Silverman  27:23

Everyone’s way of describing it.

 

Zoey  27:25

And I guess I was thinking what she could say would be something like I have a medical problem, that’s likely to happen again. Because we’re human, it’s okay to laugh and say it in a serious way so it’s not like you’re really inviting laughter but just taking the forbidden aspect out of the laughter makes it actually live maybe less likely to happen. And just that we can all move on from that. I’m a nurse, I’m a hospice nurse. I just want to thank you so much from deep deep in my heart from for sharing your experiences with your the death of your dad and your stepmom there was so there was so much that so much I’m thankful for. And also last episode, I was, you talked about hearing loss. You talked about poor eyesight. I think you’ve met mentioned granny panties. There was some other very geriatric topic, and I’m I’m myself I’m 47 and I’m just so happy that to be you know, going through this time of life with you, thanks.

 

Sarah Silverman  28:36

I love that, it’s like it is true. It’s like we’re all like everyone in our age group is like going through it together, it’s like I remember hearing about like, Steve Martin and Martin Short and or like a bunch of comedians that all scheduled their colonoscopies like on the same day and then did prep together and played poker and just took turns like running to the bathroom together. And I just like it’s so there’s something very sweet about that.

 

Presley  29:13

Hi, Sarah. I’m calling again from Barcelona. My name is Presley. Soy artista, and my previous question was about your famous dish that you would cook you may be featured in my cookbook, Sarah Silverman, very random great not special. My next question is I’m currently drawing a series based on Legendary establishments around the world. I was in LA over Christmas and I, I drew a few places for example, in of the sevens array, Casa Vega, El Compadre […] set Tower Hotel and I just wanted to know what is a legendary bar or restaurant to you? Where is the most legendary spot that I can draw in LA? Thanks a lot, bye.

 

Sarah Silverman  30:17

I mean LA is so many things, but for some reason I thought of Joan’s on Third just because I do think its aesthetic is so beautiful and I could see it drawn but Joan’s on Third is the restaurant on on third Street and it’s it’s just beautiful. It’s like there isn’t even a lot of can eat there but it’s so good. It’s just beautiful. It looks like it looks like the kitchen in every Nancy Meyers movie like I have to believe she bases her kitchens, her movie kitchens on Joan’s on Third there’s something about it, that’s like so reminds me of of any, any characters like gorgeous kitchen and a Nancy Meyers movie. Do you know what I mean? Amy?

 

Amy  31:07

Yeah, I love that idea. And I could add a few.

 

Sarah Silverman  31:10

Go on, yeah. Amy born and raised LA. So she would mean.

 

Amy  31:14

You mentioned Cantor’s, which is obviously a staple.

 

Sarah Silverman  31:17

Can’t wait, did I mentioned Cantor’s?

 

Amy  31:19

You mentioned in an answering another question when you said you were at Cantor.

 

Sarah Silverman  31:23

Oh, yeah, Canter’s, God.

 

Amy  31:27

I would say any of the delis like a Nate now, a Canter’s. I also would say that LA Los Angeles is known for its Googy establishments, which is like a mid century kind of like the way that norms looks or those old diners.

 

Sarah Silverman  31:44

And there’s Johnny’s that’s basically just for films.

 

Amy  31:48

But there’s the one that’s over on the way to the airport. That’s a really cool one. And there’s quite a few diners that still exist, I would say the original Bob’s Big Boy, in Burbank.

 

Sarah Silverman  32:00

God, you’re killing this.

 

Amy  32:01

Something to maybe look at. I mean, that’s just restaurants, and then in terms of bars, you know, some of the oldest bars are.

 

Sarah Silverman  32:09

The Formosa?

 

Amy  32:11

The Formosa or the Trocadero, which is like from the 20s. I would also argue like the Comedy Store, which is, you know, been around since the 20s, when it was cero or ciros. There’s a lot of like, historic stuff on Sunset Boulevard and old buildings that you if you drive by, you wouldn’t even notice that they were old, like like the gill Turner’s for example, that liquor store that’s like on the corner.

 

Sarah Silverman  32:38

On Sunset?

 

Amy  32:40

So I don’t know there’s quite a few cool places like old divey bars, like there was a place near where Kennedy, R F. Kennedy was shot. And it’s called the HMS bounty. It’s one of the oldest bars is kind of near Cape Town. It’s a really cool place, and then you know, there’s like Felipe downtown and there’s a lot of cool places downtown Langurs, I try to look at Langurs, too, which is an old school Deli.

 

Sarah Silverman  33:11

Oh my god, this is the best answer ever given on this podcast.

 

Amy  33:16

Wow, thank you. I’m Angelina proud Angelina and a historic preservation Commissioner West Hollywood so.

 

Sarah Silverman  33:24

That’s right.

 

Amy  33:25

Very invested in preserving old Hollywood.

 

Sarah Silverman  33:28

I love it. Yeah, there is so much even just like the Du-par’s at the grove. That old Farmers Market.

 

Amy  33:37

Absolutely, Du-par’s,  is like a very untouched I mean, it’s still got those maroon booths. And and the farmers market itself is would be equally as good.

 

Sarah Silverman  33:50

Yeah, Bob’s donuts. Well, we we watched Bosch or I was away and Rory watched Bosch. I had watched it because I just like needed something to why it’s good. And dad’s love Bosch, but um, Rory, when he moved out here I was then on you know, working out of town for like three months and he watched Bosch and then like went to all the LA because it takes place in LA and he’ll be like, this was the best I went to so and so’s the hole in the wall where you get the best bagels in LA or whatever. And he would go to all of those like Bosch tour. All right, what else?

 

Yasmine  34:29

Hello, Sarah, my name is Yasmine, everyone calls me Yas. I work for a beauty company in Canada that’s also very popular in America. Black and white stripes if you get my drift. I don’t actually even know if I can legally say I worked there but whatever. You were talking about stamp eyeliner. The brand is called Kaja, KAJA, and they make this like really, really cute little Stampee. And you just do it a little corner of your eye and a little wing and it’s part Perfect and adorable and cute and it’s all one thing and it’s from a Korean company called Kaja. They also make really cute little blushes that are little compacts and bento box face products as well. They’re just adorable. So I hope that helps. Love you girl, you don’t even make up anyways, yeah.

 

Sarah Silverman  35:17

I wrap things. Yes, I think I saw that, or did you send that to me, it’s me. It’s like, it gives you the the cat I corner little triangle and then you fill in the rest. But the part that you fill in the rest is the part that I have the problem with, which is like staying on the line above my eyelid, you know, and like making a thick line.

 

Amy  35:39

So usually, I mentioned that there was like a stamp when you mentioned it on the last show, but what you can do is just do like a dark shadow, so that it’s sort of a little smoky and then just use that stamp at the end.

 

Sarah Silverman  35:53

Oh, that’s what I started doing is I put like, I use like a dark shadow instead of a pencil and it’s just like you can mess it up a little more and then you just fix it with the Q tip.

 

Amy  36:05

Victoria Beckham’s Kajal, her she has KAJAL liners. First of all her makeup is amazing.

 

Sarah Silverman  36:13

It is?

 

Amy  36:14

Oh my gosh, and it’s clean beauty and I the liners are insane. And she also has these cream shadows in a stick and there’s probably a like I use a dark brown but I was gonna actually suggest maybe there’s a darker one that you could use for this as well like what you’re looking for.

 

Sarah Silverman  36:33

Yeah, but you use the dark brown to line your lips don’t you know.

 

Amy  36:37

I use her dark brown on my under my eyes and over my eyes to kind of make my whole eye look reddish because I have green eyes and that purples and reds pops green.

 

Sarah Silverman  36:48

What the fuck? How do you know these things?

 

Amy  36:51

I’ve been into makeup like my whole life. I’m good at doing makeup.

 

Sarah Silverman  36:55

Well fun fact about Amy’s V is she uses a black eyeliner on her lips. And that’s her only lipstick.

 

Amy  37:04

But everybody that grew up in LA in the 90s did that. It just happened to stick with me.

 

Sarah Silverman  37:12

I know it looks good.

 

Amy  37:13

But no one would ever know it was black. It just looks like I’ve got like a nice deep purple or something.

 

Sarah Silverman  37:19

Yeah, I would be I was shocked when you told me and showed me. All right, what else?

 

Amber  37:26

Hey, Sarah. It’s your best friend Amber calling from Sydney, Australia. This Saturday is the 46th annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in Sydney.

 

Sarah Silverman  37:37

Wow.

 

Amber  37:38

And to celebrate, I would just love to say to the world that I am completely and utterly gay. I’ve lived the majority of my life as a heterosexual woman. Then a few years ago, I got more comfortable with the identity of pansexual because I found that myself getting attracted to some women and some non binary people. And then last year in 2023, I finally got the flaps to take the leap and start dating women and I have to say that it has been the most beautiful and rewarding experience of my life. The depth of connection and the level of intimacy through dating women has just been like, offered studies. And so if there’s anyone out there listening who was like me and was terrified, just go for it. Find that person that you’re attracted to and just fucking go for it. What have you got to lose? Love you.

 

Sarah Silverman  38:42

Yes, Amber. Got a great call. Just a feel good call. And by the way flaps. That’s replacing lips for me. Get the flaps to do it, flaps I love that, that’s fucking great. Give it to the Australians with their they’re the best at the nicknames. Everything’s got a nickname. My sister in law Semaan. I carry this it was on this podcast that I think I made a joke about how they always have. We were laughed, she was laughing yet because I said they call the Holocaust the holy. But I made that up when I just said that they make nicknames out of everything. Was your family in the holly? All right, not funny. Funny? a little funny? But yes, I have a sister who is actually in Sydney, who is also gay in Sydney right now, but she’s taken on but congratulations. And happy 46th annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras of Australia. And what a great call. Dad, we’re winding down wherever you are in time and space. Oh, I miss you so much. We are winding down.

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  00:04

On September 27, 2018, just about everyone I knew was glued to their TV screens as a woman wearing a blue suit walked into the Senate chamber to testify against Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. With a slew of photographers crouched in front of her, she raised her right hand and swore to tell the truth about what happened to her in the summer of 1982. She believed it was her civic duty to tell Congress that the man they were considering as the next Supreme Court justice had sexually assaulted her at a party when they were both teenagers. I for one, remember her testimony clear as day. I was stuck in a chair so much that summer and early fall nursing my baby who was born in May of 2018. And I vividly recall sitting in this salmon colored glider in my son’s nursery, watching this woman on my little iPhone screen, holding on to him and hanging on to her every word. Well, behind the images on the screen. Behind that blue suit was a real life human being a mother of two named Christine, a professor, a California resident, and a big fan of Soundgarden and Metallica. She’s someone who historically hasn’t gone by the formal three name moniker. We’ve come to know her by Christine Blasi Ford. She has been Dr. Blasi, we’re just Christine, even Chrissy to a select few. And she’s now the author of a new memoir called One Way Back, where she details the life she lived before that day in the Senate chamber and how she plans to keep living the version of it that she’s in now, on the other side. It’s a very different version of her life. One with security detail, and a dining room full of letters from 10s of 1000s of strangers. The underside of her hair is no longer dyed the vibrant blue she’d worn before her day in the Senate. Many of her relationships have changed, and she’s formed new ones, including with some of the most recognizable people in the world. Of course, these huge changes make Christine a perfect person to talk to about Last Days. So without further ado, this is Last Day, a show about the moments that change us. I’m your host Stephanie Wittels Wachs. Today, I give you the gift of Christine Blasi Ford.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  02:42

Hi.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  02:43

Hi, how are you?

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  02:45

Wow, you’re wearing a Metallica shirt.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  02:48

Can you see that?

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  02:49

Oh, fuckin’ love it.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  02:53

And pajama pants as well.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  02:54

Obsessed.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  02:56

Yeah.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  02:57

Oh, my God, yes. I just finished reading your book, I loved it so much. I just enjoyed you. And I’m thrilled to talk to you today.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  03:07

Oh, thank you so much. Let’s, I’m thrilled to meet you.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  03:12

So I want to start with the before times, actually, so it’s so funny you say before times you capitalize it like we do. And you right? I missed the simple determinations I used to make in the before times. And I’d love to get a sense of what your life was like in the before times.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  03:30

Sure, so I’m a university professor, and I teach statistics, which is this class that people don’t necessarily want to take but often have to take. So I try to make it as fun as possible and as educational as possible. It’s pretty challenging class. So I do that from September until May and in between I surf as much as I can. And then in the summer. I have the summer off to be with my kids.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  04:01

I feel like surfing is such a symbol in the book, right you in the water and what it means to you. And as someone who doesn’t surf but it’s surf curious. Could you kind of break down like surfing for dummies Crash Course why you love it and why you love the water and why you love surfing,

 

Christine Blasey Ford  04:20

Sure, well, I love being in the water, especially the ocean and, and especially the Pacific Ocean with all of the biodiversity and the varying types of waves around every corner. It’s just something that I when I’m in the ocean, I feel really connected to other people who are in the ocean, even people who might be in the ocean far, far away, all at the same time so.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  04:47

Yeah, I love that. That’s yeah, that connectivity and like the bigness of it, you know, a lot of people are afraid of that bigness. But you seem to find a home in it.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  04:57

Yeah, I think I feel safer in the ocean than anywhere, but it’s it is a place to be mindful it is it can be dangerous. So you have to have some skills and some knowledge and make some decisions when you’re out there. So it’s both beautiful and a little bit scary.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  05:17

Beautiful and a little bit scary. Is that a place you kind of like to live?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  05:24

It’s like, it’s scary part doesn’t get too out of control. And yes, it’s okay, that when you’re in the ocean, and it’s scary. What’s interesting is that you don’t really have the opportunity to panic or doubt yourself, you really have to make quick decisions and stay calm, like that’s one of the things that you’re taught for ocean safety is to stay calm so you don’t really have the same opportunity to get stressed out and panic and overthink everything. And that’s kind of nice to be a little bit contained in that way just because you’re managing oncoming waves, and there’s another one behind that. There’s other surfers and rocks, there’s all kinds of things that you need to be mindful of.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  06:12

Wow. So surfing was your hobby, obviously, your passion your pastime still is it sounds like but like you said, the thing you did for work was super smart academic work up in Palo Alto. And your teaching and research, I think is such an interesting backdrop for the events that have unfolded over the last five years, you speculate that you were able to keep the trauma of your assault under the surface for so long because of the objective statistics focused way that you’d been trained to kind of look at data and and there seems to be a real turning point in the story where you feel like you can’t hold this at bay anymore where this traumatic event can’t be kept at this distance any longer. And I’m wondering if you could talk about how that felt to sort of have those two different things colliding?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  07:03

Yeah, so it was not as hard at the beginning as it became later on. And I think one thing that people don’t realize is that the process for me started three months before everyone saw me on TV so when Justice Kennedy retired, you know, I started having some thoughts about who might be the replacement and saw that news articles that mentioned Brett’s name, and was concerned and was operating on a pretty short timeline, because I think it had been announced that the nomination from this shortlist would be selected within a week or something, it was very short time period. So I felt really clear. And I was not anxious or stressed. But I was clear that I needed to say something, not necessarily to the whole world or on television, but that I needed to just say something to someone that was kind of the easier part is making that initial contact the first week of July.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  08:15

And listeners, I gotta tell you, things spiraled out of her control very quickly after that, you really do need to read her book to fully comprehend how nutty it was. But just to give you an idea, Christine says she initially talked with a few close friends about how to report this information, where to even begin, she contacted her state representative who put her in touch with Senator Dianne Feinstein, there was lots of back and forth with their respective staff. At some point, a few people encouraged her to get legal representation. When she got lawyers, those lawyers encouraged her to testify in front of Congress, that by the time she got comfortable enough with that terrifying prospect, her lawyers suddenly advised her against it. Politicians that Christine had been put in touch with kept changing their tune about how involved they want it to be, and by the time the summer came to a close, she had no idea if anything was actually going to be done. Then various details about her and her allegation leaked, articles were published and all of a sudden, a congressional testimony was back on the table and would need to happen stat.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  09:45

I really do appreciate how you, you drew this boundary in the book and you said if you want to read about what happened to me or the testimony, it’s all on public record. So I don’t even want to talk about that. What I would like to ask though is I think it’s really fascinating, like, the morning of a life changing moment. You don’t necessarily know what’s coming. I mean, you kind of did you, you were about to be put in front of a metaphorical moving train, in the Senate chamber, but you woke up that morning, and what was going through your head and what was what was going on in your body and anything like that, that kind of comes to mind about the before you went in and leading up to it?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  10:25

Yeah, for sure, the day before is worse than the day of I think with any stressful thing in life, it’s kind of like that with a doctor’s appointment or anything, or the day before is the worst. So the day of I woke up incredibly early, I got almost no sleep. And I just felt really ready, ready to get this done and be over, it had been three months of all kinds of wrangling and stress and meetings about going forward and meetings about not going forward. And that that morning, I woke up ready for this to come to an end. So I remember really clearly walking down the hallway, from the holding room to the committee room. So I remember that hallway forever. It was like it was in slow motion. The people standing in their doorways and waving at me and looking at me, and then coming into the committee room with my bodyguard, and getting to that table and chair, and then all the photographers kind of jumping up and snapping photos.

 

Judge  11:34

Do you swear that the testimony you’re about to give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? So help you God, thank you very much.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  11:44

I mean, the cameras clicking is such a visceral image. And I’m wondering, like, as you emerge out of that, what do you remember feeling and thinking sort of immediately after, right? You’ve there snapping and you’ve been grilled? And there’s all this talk between the senators and you walk out, and what is your thought?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  12:06

My thought was, that went okay, I’m okay. I’m going to be okay. And I’m going to go home and go back to California and hopefully soon be able to move out of the hotel we were living in and go back to our house and go back to work when I could. So I came out of the hearing, you know, intact, I survived it pretty well, it didn’t seem that terrible. It wasn’t my preference to have all those cameras or to have it be so public. But I didn’t know that it was going to be that public and that everyone was going to be watching it. And in a way that served me.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  12:52

I think it’s so interesting to think about that identity shift, right of like, you know, Christine, private Christine, and then push like household name, Christine.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  13:03

Yes.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  13:04

That is a major shift that I don’t think a lot of people can speak to. What do you remember about that time?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  13:12

I remember a lot of people contacting me and wanting to speak with me media, citizens, famous people. And I felt like I just needed a lot of time to come to terms with what was happening, the level of media and the level of coverage. And finding out how many people had watched it and hearing my very painful story about high school I. Yeah, it was very sudden, and people, even in my most inner circle, were sort of responding to me differently, so.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  13:53

How so?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  13:55

Just like some people seem to be a little bit in awe of me. And I think that’s one of the reasons I wrote the book is, you know, I heard from a lot of people I got correspondence from people all over the world. All 50 states 42 countries, and I think some people you know, obviously some people kind of demonized me but a lot of people idolized me and part of wanting to write the book was just to share that I’m just a person and a lot of people saying they could never do what I did and I wanted to let them know that I could never do what I did either so.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  14:36

Right, and you know when you’re this is a quick personal tangent but when you’re when you’re nursing I don’t know if you nurse your your kids, but like yes, you’re you’re in that just hole where you’re just like a cow. You’re just like, just like, cut off from the world in a different kind of a way.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  14:57

Yeah.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  14:57

I was nursing my son, when you were going through this, and I remember viscerally and vividly sitting in the chair, watching you and like, it makes me overwhelmed like being so in awe of what you were able to do.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  15:15

My motivation and coming forward was to be helpful. And to provide facts about how Mr. Cabinets actions have damaged my life. So that you could take into a serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed. It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell you the truth.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  15:42

I think it was true for so many people who watched you that you, you suddenly like became the symbol which you talked about in the book, would you have gone through this like had you known like I was going to, you know, become this thing that people were going to do to attach meaning to and symbol to? That seems like a lot of pressure for someone who was just trying to do the right thing?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  16:07

Right, yeah, I think beforehand, when you’re wrangling with something like this, and people tell you there’s going to be backlash. And it’s not a concrete thing backlash. So you’re just imagining in your head, like, what is backlash? Does that mean, people I don’t know are gonna say bad things about me. Okay, that’s okay. That’s just a tree falling in a forest somewhere. I don’t need to worry about that. But I didn’t really know in a concrete way what the backlash was going to look like. And it probably that’s good that I didn’t know. But even now that I do know, know what people are capable of and what their intent is. I still don’t regret it and still would, would do it again. It’s survivable, and I want people to take that away from my account that yes, it was extremely difficult, very painful, went through a really long grief cycle. But it’s still important that we speak up.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  17:18

Yeah.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  17:19

If we want things to be different and better. Not everyone can speak up. There’s a lot of reasons why people can’t speak up. And I’ve heard from so many survivors, so I totally understand, but for those who want to hope this gives them some more concrete examples of what that aftermath might be like.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  17:44

One part of that aftermath is that Brett Kavanaugh did indeed get confirmed to the Supreme Court. Christine’s testimony was ignored, downplayed and doubted. After the confirmation people in her life tried to reassure her that she’d done the best she could and at least it was over now. She writes that she felt quote, misunderstood by everyone on the planet. She also writes poignantly about what this outcome meant for her understanding of the political system in general, a system she had been trying to help. I think what was so heartbreaking in the book, you, I’d like to quote you to you, if you if you’ll allow me.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  18:27

Sure.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  18:29

You say I was told that even if I had medical records describing the assault and identifying Brett as the attacker, as well as 20 people saying they’d been told about it years earlier. And actual videotape of him doing it would not have made a difference. Even with that video, they could have denied it was Brett on the footage. So since it takes your breath away, and then you write, every time more information came to light about Kavanaugh or the way that confirmation was handled various contacts in DC would tell me the harsh truth, there is zero chance that anything will be done.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  19:06

And that’s after, you know, months and months and months of grieving and that natural grief part of well, someone’s going to fix this and someone, some lawyer or politician or journalist is going to get all this information together about and expose, actually what happened or maybe there will be an investigation or you know, there’s these things that you go through with grief where you’re hoping for things to happen, hoping somebody’s going to fix it. And then when people start to say to you things like what you just said nothing is going to be done. You really do have to start moving into more of an acceptance phase, and it just took me a really long time to get there. I’m a long term griever takes me a long time to get over things. So I was slow griever I guess I take it slow.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  19:57

It was slow griever, yes, yeah but I think the thing that’s so interesting about that is that you expect you the sort of human, you expect that the right thing will happen, right? Like, I’m, I had good intentions. I’m a good person, I did the right thing for the right reasons.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  20:19

Surely yes, I mean, I was trying to be helpful. And I thought, this is helpful information. And all I’m saying is, maybe you should take another look at the people, the other people on the list who were possible candidates and maybe take a deeper look into, into Brett, I was called by a higher duty and civic duty and patriotism. And I assumed that that’s how people would treat me. And instead, it felt like the people I was trying to help actually hurt me, and did not help me so that was really difficult to come to terms with.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  21:00

Yeah, I think you write really eloquently about growing up in DC, and this being such a fundamental part of your understanding about how the world works, you grew up in the hub of American democracy. The machine was all around you. And you learned to respect government, and the system and the process and how it works for the people.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  21:24

Yes.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  21:24

Of which you are one. And I’d love to know, like, what would you say you did learn about this process of the reality of how the system actually works? And how much has that sort of shifted your belief and in the system injustice and all the things that that we sort of hold as our core tenets?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  21:45

Yes. Well, I learned a lot about being an individual and trying to speak to the system and how complex that can be. I think George Washington said it in his farewell address something about like, something about how patriotism can’t override partisanships so once we have partisanship there, it’s really difficult to have patriotism. I hope I’m not butchering that farewell address, but I think it sounds great. But it’s he said something like that. So I think that I learned that that might be the state that we were in at the time. And maybe we’re still in that were a part, partisanship is sort of overriding any sense of civic duty patriotism. But nonetheless, we still need to keep trying. That’s important to keep trying.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  22:40

Perhaps even harder.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  22:41

Yes.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  23:03

We’re back. The weeks following Brett’s confirmation were devastating. After he was confirmed, Christine was still incredibly anxious and fatigued. Yet people were starting to move on. She was told there wasn’t much of a need anymore for the security guards she come to rely on, her calendar was suddenly totally empty, which for someone who loves their work, and learning and being around students felt like a void of purpose of social interaction. Everything that she knew and held dear was ripped out from underneath her.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  23:38

Yeah, that was those are hard times. So we had to reduce the security but it wasn’t safe enough for us to return to our house yet. So we’re still in hotels for several months. And I think we lived in four different places. So we were a little bit busy just because of that relocation and settling in and getting the kids to their schools, and to all their activities. And I wasn’t I just stayed inside. I didn’t go to those things. But making sure that they still got to go to school, I didn’t want them to have to miss their academic year. So I sought out my academic year. It wasn’t safe for me to go and I certainly didn’t want to put students at risk. Even if I could figure out a way to protect myself and have security for myself, it was just a little bit too much to try to strategize about how I could be in the classroom teaching so I set up for a year and actually set up for two years. So button now I’m back teachings.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  24:51

I’m so glad. I’m so glad to hear that. Yeah, it’s interesting, like we started talking about the ocean, the bigness of it. and suddenly your will got so small.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  24:54

Yeah, I just stared out the windows for so many hours and watched very micro level things happening, like trees and leaves and construction.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  25:15

Do you think that’s part of how you were able to make it through each day? Like how do you make it through each day?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  25:21

Well, maybe we all got a taste of it in the pandemic, when we were inside, it’s a little bit similar to that, where suddenly you’re you’re inside and your regular life is not happening or your job is closed or has moved online. So it was, in some ways similar to that. And yeah, you find ways to pass the time, and I would get up in the morning, and after the kids would go to school, I would stay back with the security and, and just watch the surf channel, you know, all day long, and stare out the window and hope that we were going to move back home soon.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  26:06

How did your sons and husband interact with you during this time? I mean, were they worried about you? Were they you know, how were those interactions?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  26:18

Well, during that after math period, I think that, you know, the kids certainly wanted to be back in their neighborhood. But they were, you know, kids are super resilient. So they were doing pretty well, and they were still going into school and seeing their friends. And, you know, I became like a really permissive parent, and I’m not a very permissive parents. So like, I just let them play Xbox, however long they wanted and have chocolate sundaes from room service for breakfast, or whatever they wanted to do to get through that time. So and then they got to see their friends and do middle of the week, sleepovers and, you know, there were times that we couldn’t all stay together, it wasn’t a good idea for us all to be in the same place so they would stay at different friend’s houses. And but yeah, they they definitely were more motivated to go back home. And I was I was a little bit more concerned about making sure that our house was a safe place and putting in, you know, various measures in our home that would help fortify us once we were we’re back here.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  27:22

Did you say that? Are my, am I making this up, am I projecting that you would like leave your doors open?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  27:28

Yeah.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  27:28

Like did you think about security in you know, in the before times?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  27:32

I never thought about that. I never I actually just thought they either just gonna dismiss me and be like, thanks for this information, bye or thanks for this information, we’ll do something about it and keep you posted or something, I didn’t know that it was going to be you know, not being able to be at home and needing a security detail for a while. But yeah, in the before times, we definitely had that house that anyone could just come in and come out the door opening and shutting all day with people coming in and out and playing basketball up front. coming inside and outside and all we’re all we’re welcome. And now our house is a bit of a fortress so it’s a little bit different now.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  28:17

Yeah, I have that house, not the fortress, the in and out the […] the door slam and constantly the doors and the footsteps and the running and the stairs and the yes, you know it’s it’s something a good time.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  28:33

I know […] I mean.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  28:37

You’re making me, I’m like, okay, I need to love this time. Is good and slow.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  28:42

Yeah.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  28:43

Okay, start surfing and love the slamming of the door constantly.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  28:47

Slamming of the door is hard to love, yeah, but you can get there.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  28:51

Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah, I mean, I think that was sort of like the before and then these 10s of 1000s of letters. Yes, yeah, and some were threatening and violent, hence the fortress. But many others, the majority, the overwhelming majority were so deeply supportive.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  29:11

Beautiful. Yeah, just so incredible, just an incredible outpouring, and so different from the internet. I just wish everyone could have that part of the experience, because then you see how loving and wonderful people actually are. But if you go on the internet, you don’t see that. It was almost the opposite of what I saw on the internet in terms of proportion of hate and love. And, you know, 98% of the letters were incredibly loving. And the 2% that were were horrible. Were very, very horrible, very scary. And of the 98% that were were grateful for patriotism in our country and civic duty and citizenship. 24% of those were from survivors who told me their story. So those were heartwarming and heartbreaking. And I read them with a team of my students who are experts in trauma and work at our VA hospitals. You know, we just all kept feeling the same thing we have to write back to this person we had, you know, every letter you would read and be like, I just want to call that person and tell them something. And every letter felt that way, it was just this desire to respond. So yeah, still trying to figure out how to do that, but this book is one of the ways to try to, to honor those people for helping me survive, but also to, to honor what they’ve been through which many of them have been through so much worse. And they were so generous in sharing their supportive words, and.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  31:08

What an interesting intersection, you actually had a body of students trained in trauma, who could help you sort through them. And meticulously catalog in terms of data?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  31:24

Yes, it was sort of a way to make sense of the volume of letters. When the first batches were coming in, I thought, oh, I’m going to write every buddy back. I still wish I could do that, and I did start in on that I’ve written back to anyone over the age of 90, we started undoing that part. But it took so long that we quickly realized that was not a feasible way to respond. But yes, we formed a team. And we really, were just wanting to hear everyone, the way I was heard, I wanted everyone to be heard.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  31:59

But that’s an amazing. I mean, that’s wow, they shared with you so that you could hear them, right. I mean, it’s beautiful. There’s like this triumph of the human spirit stuff, where you’re like, holy shit, we are in this together. And it is powerful, isn’t it?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  32:18

Very, very.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  32:20

Yeah, then it probably helped you to, you know, I would assume on your on your healing journey to I mean, the, the acceptance, the, you know, the grief, that you speak about so eloquently, it must have played into your ability to keep kind of putting one foot in front of the other.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  32:36

Definitely, yes. So I spent about a year reading the letters and still reading but I spent a year of full time reading the letters with my students and we were learning so much from survivors about their experiences that in a way that it can inform science and can inform clinicians working with trauma survivors, so just all so many different levels, the letters were really helpful, and especially helping me on my psychological process of of getting through through it all.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  33:16

Do you think that your work is going to be really tailored to this moving forward?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  33:20

I don’t perceive it becoming like a new area of expertise where I would teach on that topic or something, it’s more of a of another type of work that I would want to get involved in in terms of helping other people who are trying to decide how to come forward and how to be safe. I want to be helpful in that area, for sure.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  33:43

It’s so beautiful, Christine, because your goal was to help. And you didn’t help in the way that you thought you would. But you are helping in this much bigger way that I’m sure you never could have imagined. I mean, I’ve heard you say multiple times today, I want to make it better for the next person. I want to make it better for the next person, and you are.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  34:04

Thank you, it’s got it’s taken a really long time for me to even see that it the first couple of years, I couldn’t see past like, all every minor incorrect thing that was said, and I just was, you know, kind of drowning in the information and the misinformation and the hate and all of that. But now I can see and I think it’s kind of interesting and ironic how badly I wanted the meeting to be private. Because I just I’m kind of afraid of cameras and I don’t really like my picture taken even like I just don’t like that camera part of all of it. And so, if I had gotten if I had gotten my way, and I had written a letter to the head of the committee say thing for his family and for my family. I think this really would be a better idea to have a private meeting. It wouldn’t have been helpful, I guess.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  34:06

It’s true.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  34:20

And yeah, that’s kind of interesting.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  34:36

That’s the bummer. That’s the that’s the bummer.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  35:17

The great thing.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  35:19

I mean, I mean, yeah, not the same story, but lost my brother to heroin overdose was like, Oh, my God, and then got so deep into addiction work and figuring out like, why are we losing so many people? Why is this an epidemic? How can how I did 26 episodes on opioids, how can I understand what happened? And people would say, like, but you’re helping so many people, I was like, I don’t fucking want to. I was like, Tim back. I don’t this sucks. This is a horrible alternative.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  35:46

I felt that way for a long time. I mean, I’m only now able to, it’s a long, it’s a long road, as you know, it’s just a really long road, and wow, that’s amazing, you did all that work. I don’t know that I could have done that.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  36:00

You know, you could this is the thing, like I felt the same. Like, it’s that thing of like, I couldn’t yes, you can, you know, you, it’s like very selfish in the beginning, how can I understand this more? But then it really is like, how can we all do better in this arena? Can I ask you a few more questions?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  36:20

Yes.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  36:21

Okay, great, okay. Um, this Anita Hill, quote, was so resonant. Where you talk about seeing Anita Hill and then meeting her after your testimony, and her telling you to give it five years? And it’s been five years?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  36:41

Almost six, I mean.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  36:43

Wow, I know.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  36:44

That almost like I guess it’s five and a half. Because I think of the start as being June 27, so yeah.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  36:53

And I’m wondering, like, how would you say that you’ve been changed by all of this by you know, by the passing of time, like you’ve given it five years, you just spoke to it beautifully about, I didn’t used to be able to see the forest for the trees, about the helping and all of that. And I think it’s really helpful for people to hear like, time does pass, it does change. Can you speak to that?

 

Christine Blasey Ford  37:18

Yeah, I think that in that grieving process, where you just get to the point where you just think it’s not, I’m never going to be okay, again, like, I will never be okay, again. And right, it’s, like, unacceptable at first, and you just don’t want it to be that way. But as soon as you like, accept that, that, yes, you’re never going to be the same again, it’s, it’s not going to be the same. So once I started really accepting that is when I started to, to get better. And because before that, I just wanted it to be fixed, whatever that meant. So, but I think the really great thing is we can all rebuild our lives. And we’ve, a lot of us have had to rebuild our lives, like you’ve talked about with your own life, and a lot of people we all go through losing people that we love and various grief cycles. But there’s something about us that we’re wired to only suffer for so long. So I was pretty committed to the suffering path. I was on that path and just thought that’s how it’s going to be forever. And I’m like, just going to manage my grief and, and keep going and always be not okay. And, and then suddenly, like it starts to abate and and then you get to say, okay, well, what do I want my life to look like now? How do I build my life now? It’s this terrible thing, and it’s like this gift and you also wish you could give that gift to other people, without them having to go through the horrible parts, where you get to then decide, who do I want to hang out with? How do I want to spend my time and it makes everything really clear so I felt like I was given all this clarity, right? Like, I’ve changed, where I spend my time I change, I’ve changed my surf spot, I go to a different place. I’ve just made all these changes that I’m sure I would not have made. I would have just like kept complaining about or something, literally. So I made those changes, and now I just I live, I think a much more simple life and a much more minimalist life, and that’s working really well for me.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  39:40

I mean, you just essentially said exactly what I wrote in the epilogue of my book, which was when you go through something like this, it’s like your house is blown up, torn to bits and you’re just like sitting on this pile of rubble. And then you do realize at some point, okay, I have to rebuild. But what do I want to build, now? Like intentionally? What do I want it to look like? Like all that kind of and it’s like you say, can people do that without going through some sort of trauma? I don’t know, there’s a clarifying piece of it. That’s like, yeah, and that is universal. Like you’re talking about the same exact experience.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  40:23

Right, like in our crisis, we have opportunity.

 

Stephanie Wittels Wachs  40:28

Yeah, and you got to meet Oprah. And you didn’t just meet her, Christine. You got to stay at her house.

 

Christine Blasey Ford  40:34

She’s so nice. Oh my gosh, and she can drive that golf cart so well, I was scared she was driving so well.

And I was like, well, can't be worse than the shit they read out there, like, oh my god, they read they think we live in an RV. Like I was like Stella with a step up, Like she literally had someone come up to her at school and be like, oh are you in the school district or where does your RV parked? Like you live in an RV with your mom? Right, She was like, that was summer vacation. We rented that like every other family and drove up the coast and camped and they were like, oh, we thought you were homeless. So she was shamed, but she was like, imagine what it's going to be like at school when you file for divorce. I mean teens to know how to manipulate it. But I was like, yeah, it's gonna suck, but yeah, anyway, it's more the norm than isn't. So I was like, you know, but your dad and I co parents.

Anyway, I should go back to where this began, but it began eighteen years ago, so it's hard to know where to go back when telling this story. So Deane and I've been married eighteen years. We have five beautiful, amazing children together, Liam, Stella, Hattie, Finn, and Bo. They're seventeen, fifteen, twelve, eleven, and seven and the lights of my life. And yeah, so I used to have this thing. And this is nothing towards Dean. I just at some point I think I I believed in like the fairy tale, like I grew up. I mean, my father was the biggest produced television producer, so I grew up knowing there's a beginning, middle, and end, and the two main characters always start stop and there's a happy ending and an end credit. So that's what I always assume would be. And you know, I think when we're young. It's different now, but I grew up in like the eighties and on TV in the nineties, and I feel like we then were conditioned to be like we want the prince, like the night whatever, someone in white on a horse coming in swooping us up. We wanted the fairy tale. I even wanted the white picket fence. I still want that now, I just want it black. But it's but I want to well, I want of funds. But I yeah, I wanted the whole dream. But my thing was always like, even from a young age, I was like, oh, I want to be the perfect wife and mom and housewife and cook. And I was never taught how to clean, so that's not gonna happen. But uh, or cook but I taught myself. Or bake but I taught myself. But okay, but cleaning I won't do so anyway. But I wanted to be that woman. But then I was like, but I also want to like run an empire. So that's a meeting of the mind. So I'm really stubborn and I'm really driven. And I always say I'm a Philly, you can't break. I know philly means I'm young, and I'm not young. But I can still call myself a girl. I can still call myself misspelling because I can do whatever I want to do. Because we can redefine words the way they make sense to us and how we want to proceed with them. So anyway, Diana and I had this fairy tale romance even though we both were married when we met. Not fairytale right there, like, but we had other partners that we cheated on and then left and then we got together and people were like, oh, I give it six months. And we always say like, hey, it made it eighteen years. It shouldn't have made it eighteen years like it was. And I think he would say the same thing. If he and I had a real heart to heart. I think, yeah, it would have been over a lot sooner. But I think, you know, we started well. We had like pairings. We had two sets of kids, like we had Liam and Stella fifteen months apart, and I think we had Liam and Stella for a while and then I was like, oh, you know what, things were okay, but they weren't great. And I have a friend who reminded me recently that he said, do you remember what you've been telling me the whole time? And I said what, And you said, I need the extra help with hands. When they are old enough to undo their own car seats, I'll leave him. And I was like, what, When did I say that? After Bo? And he's like no, After Liam and Stella, then you got pregnant with Hattie, and then ten months later you pregnant with Finn. And then you told me when they can unbuckle and buckle their own car seat, I'll leave him, and I didn't. And then came Bo. And then with Bo, I was like, oh when he no, I just should have left after Bo. But if I had left sooner, there'd be no Bo. And I love Bo.

All the children have different personalities, different needs, and I feel like with my kids, they all have very distinct personalities. Stella was always the one since she was four years old. If she would hear us argue and then like it wasn't loud and we try to keep it separate and it wasn't bad back then, she would hysterically start crying and she would run in and she'd say, their little voice, are you going to get a divorce, and it's just like hit me hard, like Hi, I'm okay, how are you okay? I hate to do this to you while you're in the middle of you're going to work and everything they've done. It it's like one it's just the formality. It's like a one sheet you check off and next you'll have to sign it. You have a lawyer. Wait, it's going to be spun. What way that I had enough of you? What? What do you mean? I mean, in all honesty, after this whole journey. I if it's about that, like who files first, the other person's wrong if they I feel like I deserve to file first, then well, I mean you basically put it all out there with daily mail, like you said, everything that you've done to me over the years. So I think it would make perfect sense that it's followed up that I would file because those are things I would never have divulged to anybody, and you did, so I don't know. I assume that'll come later. I don't. I think it's just yeah, it's just like a one sheet where you literally like check like divorce and like irreconcilable differences. Yeah, okay, I love you, Okay, y ugh, wait, that's it. Oh my god, never felt more alone in a room full of friends to a podcast. Fuck, I've never feel more alone in fifty years.

16:26
Speaker 1
I thrive on chaos. Everyone would say that's not a good thing. Now, yeah, it gives me energy, It gives me, makes me feel like not dead inside. My lawyer says, I just got a call from TMZ. I didn't speak to them, but they have the divorce. Violet, here goes the neighborhood. I've told I've told Deana, so it's not talking out of school. But we had this very quick passionate we had this very quick passionate falling in love period, which it was. Yeah, it was the honeymoon period that everyone talks about, but what is that six months ours was four and it was intense, and I was like, wow, he sees me. I felt like my whole life I only showed people pieces of me because I was always being told who I was and could be, even from birth, like you know, born into a family where I had to uphold a certain being and you know, my house, like I was like the way I was raised was completely different than the way I raised my kids. And I'm not even talking esthetically. I'm not talking about the fact that I grew up in a ten thousand square foot house and then moved to a fifty six thousand square foot house irrelevant. I'm just kiddinking. I'm talking about like it was never a conversation, like you were quiet, and no one ever said this to me, No one said like you can be seen and not heard. But like it was that feeling that I got, like while it was a family, it was a public family, and you learned very quickly, like you know, four or five years old, I got it. I got it that all eyes were on us and everyone was watching and listening to how we behaved and how what we said and how we represented this iconic Hollywood family. When I say week, because I have a brother who is an amazing podcast called Oldish with my bff Brian Austin Green and Sharna on iHeart, and yeah, he was like less willing to conform. I always was in the mindset like of representing your family. So yeah, I don't know I was. I just got it from an early age. I would I was fascinated with the world summer vacation. I didn't want to hang with my friends. I wanted to go to work with my dad. I would literally hide under his desk and take notes and like that was my world from jump, you know, I used to like walk around My mom had every script that my dad ever did, the initial one because there were over what two hundred, like it couldn't be every single one, but if it was a series, it was the pilot script. If it was a movie of the movie, obviously leather Bound and in his office wall to wall, and every Saturday, I would spin around like wonder Woman, and I'd be like wonder Woman and I'd land on a script and I would pull that script out and I would read it. Obviously, this is when I could read, so it was like eight nine. And then I'd ask my dad if he could play the male lead, and I obviously would play the female lead because I didn't think outside the box then, and we would read through it and I'd be like, I'm gonna make these one day and like make like not just like, oh, I'm gonna star in these. I'm like, I'm gonna star, I'm gonna write, I'm gonna produce, I'm gonna direct, I'm gonna own this motherfucker's shit. What's a motherfucker shit? I don't know what that is, but I'm gonna own it.

20:57
Speaker 3
Well, you are your father's daughter. Yeah, the end of the day.

Well, you are your father's daughter. Yeah, the end of the day.
21:02
Speaker 1
Anyway, we had this fast and furious romance. I saw red flags. Everyone talks about red flags, like I like saying that. I just like I like to make dresses out of red flags and then proceed. So, yeah, there were definitely red flags. And he had anger issues and that started when we were dating, like four months in and I just remember like I could show him me and it wasn't like the cute like giggly like this is what people want me to be. I was able to be like the loud and like the body type of like toy and like I could have like you know, I could have a foul mouth. I could I'm not you know, just Donna Martin like the perfect good girl, like I could have some bad girl in me, and it was okay, and and he like all those sides, and he saw how smart I was and accepted me. And I said, from the beginning, it's gonna be a lot. It's I've been told it's an emasculating road. And he was like, I can handle it, and I was like, can you though, like it's not going to be easy, Like I can't. I don't think he knew how big it would be, how how big the life I was given and live is. It's yeah. I think he was like, oh yeah, things come and go, But with me, it never came and went like it was. I from the moment we met, I was in the moment I was born. I was in the press, you know, and it hasn't there hasn't been a reprieve from it. So it's like you kind of have to be used to like jumping on board in that world and just getting through it and owning it, and I thought he was on board with that, but I was also all very focused on him, and I think a lot of parents out there can relate, like I noticed a shift in our relationship literally the day I found out I was pregnant, And the shift came from within, because all of a sudden, it wasn't. It was never about me, like I have kept myself small since I was young, to not outshine anyone in my family, and then not outshine anyone in my cast, and then not shine outshine any boyfriend I had, or outshine any husband like so I would just self sabotage and keep myself small and wouldn't keep building myself up where I knew I could be, And anytime it would start to get big or real, I would find a way to plummet it and start back over again, like I'm doing now, but this time I'm not backing down. I'm just going all the way to the top. Well, you guys all heard that, right, hold me accountable. But yeah, as soon as it wasn't, you know all about him, And I don't think he intentionally did this. All the focus changed to the baby growing in my belly and instantly I changed, and I was like, Oh, this is what it's like to really take control and step up and be accountable for someone that you don't even know yet. And everything we came about Liam, who was in my belly, and you know, I was never the adventure girl, but when I met Dean, we made Oh my god, we made a list on the back of barf bags in the plane on the way back from Ottawa where we were filming the TV movie where we hooked up, coming back to our mary, you know, our spouses. We rode on barf bags what things we were going to do, like a bucket list in our relationship. And for me, it was like doing things that I was always scared and fearful, Like I got that from my dad. My dad was scared of everything, and I just took that on thinking they were my fears. And now I'm like, wait, someone else's fears, Like maybe it wasn't my fears, Like maybe I do want to jump out of airplane. Now I'm just kidding psych Uh, I don't know. But it was things like that, like we're gonna go here, We're gonna I think I said, I'd like ride a marathon. I don't even know how to ride a bike. But I the thing is, I tried, and I wanted something different and I wanted to please him. And then when I got pregnant, we got pregnant right away. So we got married in May, and we started trying right away. We didn't get pregnant right away, and my dad passed in June, and then days later, the beginning of July, found out I was pregnant. No, it was right like a month after my dad passed. Basically I conceived like right after my dad passed, and so I took that as like, oh, it's a sign, this is supposed to be and this is how it was planned to happen. But honestly, our relationship was never the same after we started having kids, like and we always said we won't be those parents that change. We'll make sure we make our relationship with priority and the two of us and we have date nights, and just everything went out the window. I became completely focused on the kids and kind of left him in a way. And I get it. It doesn't excuse his behavior and everything he did and how he handled things. And I'm not minimizing his part in this and how his lack of sobriety did affect me and the kids for years and years and years, and I'm really happy that he's sober now. But our relationship definitely changed, like to the point where I felt like I was just in this alone with the kids, like and he was there and he was an extra set of hands and he put the car seat in because I know how to do it, and you know, things like that. But emotionally, like I was like Taggert, like I was the parent and it was a lot of responsibility while also you know, rebuilding a career, which I did. You know, we became a family brand. I went from like you know, Hollywood rich girl like starlet, like starlett that's as bad as my calling myself a sex symbol. Sorry, h anyway, to like cool mom, like look at her, she does it all Meanwhile, like behind the scenes, it was all falling apart. And I literally sometimes I went back and reread one of my books once and I was like wow, Like sometimes I think I created the character of Dean, like all those Prince charmings I wanted when I was young, Like I created this character that he had a lot of those qualities. But you know, we did our reality show, and it was like the first one was like fun fun, So any like bad stuff that would happen or fights or anything, they would edit, and you know, women everywhere I would hear them be like I wish I had a Dean, and I was like, you only knew, if you only knew?

Anyway, we had this fast and furious romance. I saw red flags. Everyone talks about red flags, like I like saying that. I just like I like to make dresses out of red flags and then proceed. So, yeah, there were definitely red flags. And he had anger issues and that started when we were dating, like four months in and I just remember like I could show him me and it wasn't like the cute like giggly like this is what people want me to be. I was able to be like the loud and like the body type of like toy and like I could have like you know, I could have a foul mouth. I could I'm not you know, just Donna Martin like the perfect good girl, like I could have some bad girl in me, and it was okay, and and he like all those sides, and he saw how smart I was and accepted me. And I said, from the beginning, it's gonna be a lot. It's I've been told it's an emasculating road. And he was like, I can handle it, and I was like, can you though, like it's not going to be easy, Like I can't. I don't think he knew how big it would be, how how big the life I was given and live is. It's yeah. I think he was like, oh yeah, things come and go, But with me, it never came and went like it was. I from the moment we met, I was in the moment I was born. I was in the press, you know, and it hasn't there hasn't been a reprieve from it. So it's like you kind of have to be used to like jumping on board in that world and just getting through it and owning it, and I thought he was on board with that, but I was also all very focused on him, and I think a lot of parents out there can relate, like I noticed a shift in our relationship literally the day I found out I was pregnant, And the shift came from within, because all of a sudden, it wasn't. It was never about me, like I have kept myself small since I was young, to not outshine anyone in my family, and then not outshine anyone in my cast, and then not shine outshine any boyfriend I had, or outshine any husband like so I would just self sabotage and keep myself small and wouldn't keep building myself up where I knew I could be, And anytime it would start to get big or real, I would find a way to plummet it and start back over again, like I'm doing now, but this time I'm not backing down. I'm just going all the way to the top. Well, you guys all heard that, right, hold me accountable. But yeah, as soon as it wasn't, you know all about him, And I don't think he intentionally did this. All the focus changed to the baby growing in my belly and instantly I changed, and I was like, Oh, this is what it's like to really take control and step up and be accountable for someone that you don't even know yet. And everything we came about Liam, who was in my belly, and you know, I was never the adventure girl, but when I met Dean, we made Oh my god, we made a list on the back of barf bags in the plane on the way back from Ottawa where we were filming the TV movie where we hooked up, coming back to our mary, you know, our spouses. We rode on barf bags what things we were going to do, like a bucket list in our relationship. And for me, it was like doing things that I was always scared and fearful, Like I got that from my dad. My dad was scared of everything, and I just took that on thinking they were my fears. And now I'm like, wait, someone else's fears, Like maybe it wasn't my fears, Like maybe I do want to jump out of airplane. Now I'm just kidding psych Uh, I don't know. But it was things like that, like we're gonna go here, We're gonna I think I said, I'd like ride a marathon. I don't even know how to ride a bike. But I the thing is, I tried, and I wanted something different and I wanted to please him. And then when I got pregnant, we got pregnant right away. So we got married in May, and we started trying right away. We didn't get pregnant right away, and my dad passed in June, and then days later, the beginning of July, found out I was pregnant. No, it was right like a month after my dad passed. Basically I conceived like right after my dad passed, and so I took that as like, oh, it's a sign, this is supposed to be and this is how it was planned to happen. But honestly, our relationship was never the same after we started having kids, like and we always said we won't be those parents that change. We'll make sure we make our relationship with priority and the two of us and we have date nights, and just everything went out the window.

Yeah, you guys did go into therapy right to try to work through the issues.

Yeah, you guys did go into therapy right to try to work through the issues.
29:19
Speaker 1
Yeah, I mean we we saw a therapist that I had been seeing since like my twenties. She was actually, this is horrific that I did this. I was scared to confront and tell my first husband that I was leaving him for my co star. So I broke the news to him in my therapist's office. So not cool. So anytime Dean and I would go into therapy, he's like, are you gonna leave me like you did Charlie in the therapy session. I'm like no, He's like, well you did it once. I was like, fair, fair, no, I'm not going to So I never did.

30:03
Speaker 3
But.

But.
30:07
Speaker 1
It was it was hard the therapy sessions. I like wanted to get deep and we started therapy. I mean after Stella was born and she's we have five kids, you know, she's fifteen. Now, so yeah, did it.

It was it was hard the therapy sessions. I like wanted to get deep and we started therapy. I mean after Stella was born and she's we have five kids, you know, she's fifteen. Now, so yeah, did it.
30:24
Speaker 3
Help at all? Do you think?

Help at all? Do you think?
30:27
Speaker 1
No? No, because we were talking about two different things. You know, we would go in there and I'm really good at taking blame so that someone can start to feel like they can open up, and you know, yeah, so I would say like, you know, I do this and I do that, hoping he would be like, oh, and I do this, and instead, you know, it was more focused on like, uh yeah, the dog shit all over the house, like she's just too much, the animals, she has a hoarder, like she's messy. And I was like, yep, yep, yep, that's me. And I'm like, wait, wait, wait, I always say to him, we actually he and I had this conversation semi recently and I was like, when we met in Ottawa, you met me, you came into my hotel room where we were filming. I had my two dogs with me, and what was one of the first things you saw? And He's like, you had your suitcases open and there were clothes and shoes covering the entire room and you had to make space so we could walk through to get to the bed to f sex. I'm like yes, and he's like, and there was dog shit in the on top of the clothes in your suitcase. I'm like, correct, that was me and the first night you met me, So what about me is surprising? Now married to me years later with kids, then I'm messy and that the dog shit everywhere and I don't pick it up. I'm just kidding. I eventually pick it up.

No? No, because we were talking about two different things. You know, we would go in there and I'm really good at taking blame so that someone can start to feel like they can open up, and you know, yeah, so I would say like, you know, I do this and I do that, hoping he would be like, oh, and I do this, and instead, you know, it was more focused on like, uh yeah, the dog shit all over the house, like she's just too much, the animals, she has a hoarder, like she's messy.

Anyway, Yeah, he would talk about stuff like that, and you know, a therapist will go in the direction you start talking, and that's where our entire hour would go to. Actually it's never an hour. They tell you have an hour session. It's really fifty minutes. And it's really frustrating because the whole time I'm looking at the clock and I'm like, ooh, I know I have forty minutes left. Oh, I know I have twenty minutes left. What do I talk about now he's still talking about dog shit. We're fucked and this is three hundred dollars, Like, oh, who cares about the dog shit? Like I would always say, what does it matter? I mean, it does matter. I get it, Listen, I get that's a problem, but it clearly wasn't our biggest problem.

Lit, I would say, his temper, which often was fueled by alcohol. So when he would drink, it was hard because I knew that at some point it would turn, and I knew, you know, it was all always different, like it could be two drinks, it could be five, six drinks, and then I would just see it turn. I'm like, here we go. And then that became my dance on the eggshells. And it was like no matter what I said, it wasn't right, and I would have to in my head be like okay, quick, quick, quick on your toes. Like it was like it was like a fight, like you know, a mental fight, like okay, uh, I think he might like aim here, and if he aims here, like with what he says, I'm going to respond this way and that'll take him down. And it got to the point where nothing would make sense and it just I would just notice stop talking, like and that usually you know, just space and stop talking. And it was just it was hard.

34:46
Speaker 3
Until the final fight, right where he went on Instagram and announced that you guys were separating and that's sort of the final blow for you, and that put everything in motion.

Until the final fight, right where he went on Instagram and announced that you guys were separating and that's sort of the final blow for you, and that put everything in motion.
35:01
Speaker 1
The Instagram posts. So I'm the type that I will take a lot and you can say whatever you want to me. I remain calm. I process it. I think about what I'm going to say before I say it. I'm not a reactive person. Lots of years of training. I know the therapy words to say. I feel oh man, But yeah, that last night, we had just been at Jenny's house all day. We were doing a BFF photo shoot and Dean was so helpful, like he was so great, and Jenna and Dean haven't always gotten along, and I just remember that day. She was like, he was really great and he helped and styled and carried and did everything for us that whole day because we didn't have the budget to like hire people and we had to do the whole photo shoot ourselves and video shoot just me and Jen. And he was great. And when I got home, she texted me and she said Dean was really great today. And I was like, Oh, that's going to mean a lot to him for me to go in and say, Jen gave you a compliment. She would laugh at this, but I did, and he was like, really, Oh, that's that is great. Months later, when I reminded him of this, he doesn't remember that part. But I'm like, okay, yeah, you got a compliment from someone that doesn't give compliments freely, like that's a big step. And he was like, thank you, Okay, that feels really good. It was nice helping you guys today. And then but he had been drinking at this point. It was in the evening, and then we started to discuss something else and I could tell like, ooh, he's fired up and it's not going to go well. And in my head I'm like, stop talking, walk away, because otherwise this is going to escalate. But once in a blue moon, I don't just walk away and I don't just shut up. I come back. And I always say it's the tourus in me, like stubborn, like the tourists, like we'll make peace with everyone and super patient and we'll be like I'm sorry, it's me, it's not you. And then like you push us, you push us, you push us, and then we just snap. But me snapping isn't even like bad, Like imagine me snapping, like it's not crazy. But yeah, that's all it took. And so but I'll never forget the night because sorry, I'm a foodie, so I associate everything with food. Okay, it's not a bad thing. And we just ordered Wendy's and I'm not gonna lie. I'm a big baked potato fan, loaded baked potato. My mom taught me how to make him. I make them for everybody AnyWho. So I had just gotten my baked potato from Wendy's and I was super psyched about it because I had a long work day and I was like, ooh, and I made it to perfection. I was like, m this is a baked potato my mom would be proud of. And just as I had made it, he came into the kitchen because it was a conversation. We had started fighting, and I walked away, still passive aggressively saying things because I'm passive aggressive trying to work on that, and he's like, what did you say? Did you say? And I was like, hm, uh huh, proceed I said this and yeah. So it just like escalated and he came in screaming, and he he made a remark that I don't want to discuss, but it's not even a terrible remark. It's just it was a dig at something he knew would really be hurtful to hear, and I think it was just in the moment he made that dig, and it's really nothing, but it's something that I took personal. And when he said that, fine, I'll say what he said. He said to go back to dog shit because he loves talking about dog shit and animal shit and feeces, feces. Uh, he said, Uh, I'm so sick of this. I've been picking up Tory spelling shit for eighteen years hers and I've fucking lost it.

But we have to shout out McGill University, IFL Science and Science Times for helping round this idea hour this story out. But we're talking about something called the Marico Aoki phenomenon, which is a very specific phenomenon. It's where some people go into a bookstore and are overwhelmed with the urge, sometimes an urgent urge to poop in that bookstore, not like in the aisles of the bookstore, but to go to the bathroom in the bookstore to poop.

Speaker 2
Yeah, so here's my story. In high school, still one of my very best friends, Jim, I say, you know, Jim, Jim and I had an afternoon radio show, which was over the intercom of the school, and it was basically instead of the principal reading the daily announcements, we asked if we could take it over and round it out with jokes and top ten lists and what have you. So we had WRHS was our dumb little show.

Speaker 2
No, no, no. It was us in the principal's office like on the microphone every day. I mean that was looking back, it was the start of stuff you should know, which is funny. Oh wow, But we did. When we would meet to write the show. Every day, we would meet in the empty auditorium where they did school plays, and every time we were in there, both of us had to poop and we used to laugh about it and talk about it. And now that I see sort of some of the similarities between that empty, quiet auditorium and a sort of a large, maybe cavernous, quiet bookstore, I now know this is a thing.

No, no, no. It was us in the principal's office like on the microphone every day. I mean that was looking back, it was the start of stuff you should know, which is funny. Oh wow, But we did.

02:44
Speaker 2
Okay? And she wrote a letter to the you know, like a letter to the editor kind of thing, where she said, I'm not sure why, but since about two or three years ago, whenever I go to a bookstore, I'm struck by an urge to move my bowels. They printed it, just the letter to the editor, and then got so many responses from people saying me too, that the next issue had a fourteen page feature article on the headline was the phenomenon currently shaking the bookstore industry.

03:11
Speaker 1
Yeah, and it became like such a thing that it took her name, Marico Aoki. Even though there has been people have turned up mentions of this kind of thing as far back as the fifties, I could not find any original source material of that, but I think I'm willing to take IFL Science on their word if they were the one where I got it from. But in Japan it kicked off like a trend, right, So there were kind of like game show informal studies of what exactly was going on, and they did turn up some data, not exactly like you know, peer review shorthy data, but they found that about ten percent of the respondence in Japan feel the urge to poop when they go into the bookstore. So the Marryoki Aoki phenomenon is it covers about ten percent of the population. I'm squarely in the ninety percent. You're apparently in the ten percent.

04:09
Speaker 2
Well, I mean, I haven't tested it with a bookstore, but there are similarities between. For us, it always felt like like Jim's theory was that it was a big being alone in a very big, large, empty quiet.

I guess so, but you know, a bookstore isn't empty, but it's not like going to a concert. It is generally pretty quiet, so and there's like some there's a privacy aspect I think to a bookstore. I mean I'm thinking larger bookstores, not like you know, the tiny mom and pops, which I love. So I don't know that was his theory. Lease, so I guess I'm in that ten percent. I'll go to a bookstore and I'll let you know.

04:55
Speaker 2
Oh my god, you might He'll be right back. Should we take a break, Yeah, all right, we'll come back and talk about some of the theories right after this. If you want to know, then you're in luck. Just listen to Chuck selfus.

Oh my god, you might He'll be right back. Should we take a break, Yeah, all right, we'll come back and talk about some of the theories right after this. If you want to know, then you're in luck. Just listen to Chuck selfus.
05:27
Speaker 1
Chuck, I think I speak on behalf of at least half of the people listening. Would you and Jim go poop at the same time, or would you like take turns?

Chuck, I think I speak on behalf of at least half of the people listening. Would you and Jim go poop at the same time, or would you like take turns?
05:37
Speaker 2
I don't remember that part. I don't even know if we went and pooped or if it was just like, oh I got a poop, I see, I see.

I don't remember that part. I don't even know if we went and pooped or if it was just like, oh I got a poop, I see, I see.
05:42
Speaker 1
Okay, Yeah, so yeah, anyway, we're back.

Okay, Yeah, so yeah, anyway, we're back.
05:46
Speaker 2
Yeah, we're back. There is no like serious science probably about this, but there are a lot of pretty interesting theories, and one of them is something that we've talked about. In fact, we did a whole show sort of, didn't we about the gut brain axis we did.

Yeah, we're back. There is no like serious science probably about this, but there are a lot of pretty interesting theories, and one of them is something that we've talked about. In fact, we did a whole show sort of, didn't we about the gut brain axis we did.
06:04
Speaker 1
I don't.

I don't.
06:05
Speaker 2
It's something about like when you approach the front door of your.

It's something about like when you approach the front door of your.
06:07

House, that's the brain bladder connection.

House, that's the brain bladder connection.
06:09
Speaker 2
Oh okay, I think this is kind of similar though, right, No, totally.

Oh okay, I think this is kind of similar though, right, No, totally.
06:13
Speaker 1
I think the second theory, the smell of books, which we'll get to, is more brain bladder connection. But the gut brain axis would have come up in I guess, like I can't remember what it was, but we talked about like a whole episode about how there's neurons in your gut and like your brain and your gut, your central nervous system and your enteric nervous system communicate to one another. And so that's probably the likeliest explanation for why somebody would feel the urge to poop in a bookstore.

06:41
Speaker 2
Yeah, there are some other you know. To me, I think it's all of these things added together. There is that there is also this sort of connection of like people like reading on the toilet has long been something that people do, right. People are on their phones now, but in the old days, you had that magazine. Rack still got a magazine right next to my toilet, and we'll read a good magazine. So that connection. Maybe that subconscious thing of when you're among those books, your sphincter just a moocks, just a little bit, maybe.

Yeah, there are some other you know. To me, I think it's all of these things added together.

Maybe that subconscious thing of when you're among those books, your sphincter just a moocks, just a little bit, maybe.
07:12
Speaker 1
Yeah, for sure. So whatever it was, whatever, if it's like the smell of books, that's kind of usually put forth. Whatever it is that you associate with a bookstore, and then you poop in the bookstore. That's where your gut brain access would take over and you develop this association. So when you walk into the bookstore, your brain goes, hey, gut, we're in a bookstore. You better get busy pooping.

Yeah, for sure. So whatever it was, whatever, if it's like the smell of books, that's kind of usually put forth.

So when you walk into the bookstore, your brain goes, hey, gut, we're in a bookstore. You better get busy pooping.
07:38
Speaker 2
Yeah, makes sense. Another one, of course, is a bookstore oftentimes there's a lot of squatting. Yeah, if you want to book down on that bottom shelf, or you want to peruse for a little while on the bottom, you're going to be squatting down. And humankind didn't evolve to poop like we poop. Now you're supposed to squat. And if you've ever in in that dead squat position with your butt just barely above the ground and all your weight, like everything lines up in such a way to where your body goes, oh, it's go.

Yeah, makes sense. Another one, of course, is a bookstore oftentimes there's a lot of squatting.

08:09
Speaker 1
Time, it's time, yeah, and he goes.

Time, it's time, yeah, and he goes.
08:13

So you're in there already, it's quiet. You got the smell of the books you're squatting.

08:22
Speaker 1
Yeah, how could anybody not poop?

08:24
Speaker 2
You may have a coffee, that's a big one.

A lot of people say, yeah, people drink coffee and bookstores and coffee makes you poop.

Yeah. So I think it's like all this stuff sort of adds up to, oh my god, I'm in a bookstore. I've got to go.
08:36
Speaker 1
There's another theory that isn't specifically identified as from Japan. But if it's not from Japan, I will eat my hat and I don't even have a hat. I'll go buy a hat to eat it. If this isn't a Japanese theory, that because life is stressful, when you walk into a bookstore, a bookstore is very calm, and so you feel relieved and so you want to leave yourself.

09:21
Speaker 2
You get some nice legs thanks, And then of course you have to think about or at least consider the frequency illusion aspect of this. It's a type of confirmation bias, whereas once you know this is a thing, you start to just it's in your head all of a sudden, and you're making that connection where it previously didn't exist, So you know, you have to kind of consider that for sure.

09:44
Speaker 1
Yeah, that's what skeptics say. They say there's no such thing as the Mark Aoki phenomenon, that actually it's it's people just have heard of it, and maybe she had some sort of Pavlovian training where like the smell of the books made her want to poop, but just talk about it. It getting published and becoming a thing in Japan, then traveling around the world, people started saying like, oh, yeah, I've pooped in bookstores too, So then anytime they poop in a bookstore from that point on they notice it. It confirms their theory that they're susceptible to the Ma Aoki phenomenon, and it just becomes like a self fulfilling prophecy. But at the same time they're also ignoring all the times they go to the bookstore and don't poop, or they go to pet Co and have to poop. You don't want to do although you could just poop in the aisle and blame it on the dog. But still that's part of the frequency illusion.

10:37
Speaker 2
Yeah, for sure. So I'm curious to hear from people two types of people, people that have experienced this, whether in a bookstore or like my situation, like a large empty room, or bookstore employees who are like, dude, you don't know that the nightmare that we live.

Yeah, for sure. So I'm curious to hear from people two types of people, people that have experienced this, whether in a bookstore or like my situation, like a large empty room, or bookstore employees who are like, dude, you don't know that the nightmare that we live.
10:53

Yeah, I can imagine, you know, Yeah, I hadn't thought about that. Man's better thought for the bookstore employees.

What happened to your daughter, Tiffany? She was murdered. She had just gotten married three months before that. The entire community was in fear. Yes. There's a killer on the loose. Off-word, the girls, they were doing ordinary things. Laura Smith was jogging down the road. If you can remember anything, please contact the police Department. Kelly Cox was going to school. Tiffany Johnson was washing her car at a car wash. Jessica came to just having dinner with some friends. This is just snatching girls up in broad daylight. Then it just happened to cross the path of a serial killer. We could be the next one. There's nothing in this world more powerful or compelling than you're going to find your child. This case has been cold for so long, and there's finally an answer. One, they got from a stunning tape seen in public for the very first time tonight. As you relax and let go, you were turned into hypnosis. He was a pretty much one-man crime freak. You started driving until you found something. Constantly hunting He was a predator on the proud. Sounds like a monster. Four young women disappear in 1997. It's a mystery that baffles investigators and fuels their family's quest for answers for almost 25 years.

[00:01:38]
The first to vanish is Laura Smither, just 12 years old. What was Laura like? She was a joy. She was so sweet and so caring and so fiercely loyal to all her girlfriends. She was one of my best friends. We spent a lot of time together. Everybody loved Laura. She was just one of those people. I always say she was touched by light because everybody loved her. She was the friend that would come over to your house and make you look bad because she would help put away the dishes after dinner. And Laura wasn't perfect. She was a normal kid, but she was very smart, wickedly smart. She could have done anything. She would have turned 13. She'd been counting down the days for 87 days. She was so excited to become a teenager. In 1997, Friendswood was just a very quiet small town. So we're about halfway between the city of Houston and Galveston. In '97, we had been voted one of the top 10 safest cities in America. Laura lived near the creek, and their house was magical because I would go there and they would always have the computers going, and we could go outside and explore and climb trees.

[00:03:11]
There wasn't a lot of development in the area. It was a quiet country road. Laura lived on Waredare at the end. And so if we were in the kitchen, you could see right to the end of the road from inside the house. Laura wanted to be a professional ballerina. She had just accepted into the Houston Ballet Academy. Ballet was probably the most important part of her life besides her family. She loved to dance. She was always choreographing little pieces, and she'd put on little plays for us. She started when she was six. She did ballet, tap, and jazz. Wow, for six years. But she just really loved ballet more than anything. Take me back to April third, 1997. What are you doing that morning here? It was a Thursday. Because I'd been out of town, I said, Okay, we'll do Pancakes with Bacon, which was Laura's favorite. She just finished reading a book, and it was all about running and exercise and building your endurance. She felt that if she did that, she could hold her arabesque longer, and it would make her stronger ballet. And her dad was a runner. He ran every day.

[00:04:33]
So I granted her permission to go running while we fixed breakfast. And of course, she didn't come back. We knew immediately that something was wrong. Immediately. And we called the police within an hour of that happening. But our top story tonight, she's only 12 years old, and at this hour, she's missing. It made the news that first day. While police concentrate the search near the girls' home, her parents wait and hope. It's just been concentrated here around the house. As far as I know, there are some open fields that she might have run by, and they've searched those areas very thoroughly. She is a very good girl. Something very unusual has happened that she would have been home. Someone had to have taken The search continues this morning for a missing 12-year-old Friendswood girl. Did you see anything unusual at this time yesterday? Nothing. Did you see my daughter? I ended up running the ground search, and I was drinking from my fire hose. Hundreds of people flattered to come help us search, and then it just exploded. Overnight, family, friends blanketed the neighborhood with flyers At daylight, a small army of searchers fanned out.

[00:06:05]
Rory's dad went out with the first wave of volunteers, grateful for all the support. Someone encouraged by the turnout this morning. I've been overwhelmed by the community, the support and the police. What was it like for you and your family last night? Don't ask me. Laura was a 12-year-old little girl, and it just touched people. The community Friendswood is very close, and they felt that Laura was one of their own. I'm going home. I'm going to hug my kids and regroup a little bit, and I'll be ready to run in the morning. People from all over Houston put their lives on hold. The best came out in some people. We offer it to you and pray that you would watch over Laura wherever she is. People of different denominations, different faiths, all showing up together to pray for this child, hoping that maybe that will have some power. I just want to let her know that we are going to find you, and we're not going to stop until we do find you. Please keep her in your prayers. The FBI has been called in on this search, and now police are calling it an abduction.

[00:07:18]
Their parents grow more frantic by the hour. Volunteers trudged through swamps and dodged snakes, but by days in, there was nothing to report. It was a tough search for anyone involved in being out there. That went on for days. They covered over 75 square miles. They plan to do the same thing again until Laura is found. There is a maximum commitment to find you and do everything the law permits to bring you to justice. Just about every place they see an area was involved in a search. You have a 12-year-old girl who goes jogging 9:00 in the morning. For whatever reason, no one saw anything. She was here one second and gone the next. We were worried that whoever took her was still out there and that we could be the next one. And their top story this morning, what could be a nightmare comes true. She's like, deja vu. Somebody had to have taken her. It's like she just disappeared. It has almost picture-perfect ties to the Smithier case. The entire community was in fear. Yes. There's a killer on the loose. Exactly. The search goes on for 12-year-old Laura Kate Smithr. There's no sign of a 12-year-old girl.

[00:08:40]
The ground search is swelling into its sixth day. Whoever has Laura, we would like you to bring her home now. Three weeks after she disappears, there's a town hall made. Just remember sitting there feeling numb. This was for my child. You need to allow the chief and the FBI some time to analyze some of the information. It was a couple of hours later before the police chief made it here to tell us that indeed a body had been found. And it was like a dark blanket just swallowed the household. We just were silent. Nobody spoke. The police left, and we just all stayed in this room all night. Based on our knowledge of the case and evidence recovered at the scene, I am prepared to say that the young lady found is in fact, Laura K. Smith. She had a ring that she would wear. It had her initials, and she was wearing her socks. It's a It's a hole. It's just a void that exists for a long time, and even now. The city was heartbroken. People, I think, felt like that could have been their child. And so Laura was everybody's child. Once Laura was found, I think it was understood at that point that this was not an accident.

[00:10:24]
This was an intentional abduction and homicide of a 12-year-old. We were worried that whoever took her was still out there and that we could be the next one. Three months later, in 300 miles north, those worries proved true. When a Another woman goes missing. 20-year-old Kelly Cox heads out for the day and is never seen alive again. What was Kelly Cox like growing up? Growing up, she was always very independent, even as a little child. I mean, one time I told her, Don't put your fingers on that again. So she reached over with her toes. Kelly had a really good sense of humor. Kelly Cox is also a mom to her own independent daughter, Alexis. Say hi to the camera. Say hi to the red light. Hi. Kelly was a young mom. She had big plans and big dreams. You need to mom me some sugar. How old was she when she had Alexis? She was 19, just barely 19. Did she like motherhood? She said it was the happiest day of her life. Listen here, Ms. Zane, you need the last, last, last. The day that Alexis was born. And she said that any number of times.

[00:11:54]
Happiest day of my life, Mom. Do you have memories of your mom, Kelly? I always knew I was loved. It was beautiful the way she giggles with me and the way I giggle back as a baby. She was an excellent student and very focused. She delivered Alexis, and a week later, she took her finals at the community college. Made all A's. Kelly breezes through community college. And then heads to the University of North Texas studying psychology and criminal justice with plans to be a therapist. I'm like, wow, you're really on track. She had a plan, and she was sticking to it. I mean, I think she would have been a phenomenal mother. Bettering her future so she could better our future. She said, Mom, I need to support Alexis and me. And that's one reason she insisted on summer school classes because She wanted to graduate in May of '98. She would have been a phenomenal role model as well. But sometimes it's the way that things go. Tell us about that morning. It's like it just happened yesterday. She was leaning back in her bed, her hair up on top of her head. I said, Have a good day.

[00:13:24]
I love you. I'll see you this afternoon. On July 15, 1997, Kelly was touring the city of Denton Jail for her criminal justice class. So she comes out of the building, and what happens? She tried to get into her car. She couldn't get into it.Couldn't open the door?Couldn't open the door. The key would not work. So she walks to a nearby convenience store to call her boyfriend for help. But by the time he arrives here, Kelly is nowhere to be found. When he got there, her car was there in the parking lot. But of course, she was nowhere to be seen. He opened the car, sat in there. She never showed up. So he left a note saying, Hey, it got hot. Call me. Kelly's seen on surveillance video. She was seen doing the tour of the jail. They didn't have cameras on the outside. There was no cameras or anything over there at the gas station. No cameras in the immediate vicinity. They confirmed that Kelly did go inside the gas station, so they knew that she was there, but no one saw where she went. She just disappeared. The police station is on one end of the road, and where Kelly was at is on the other end of the road.

[00:14:55]
But it was within probably 200 yards of the police station. It's pretty bold to kidnap a young woman next to a police station. It was real scary because you just don't know. It was so unlike her. She wouldn't just leave her car in abandon it. And it was at four o'clock on that day that Lawrence called me, the boyfriend called me, and asked me if I had heard from Kelly. And then when 5:30 finally rolled around, I knew Without a doubt, something bad was wrong because that's when she was supposed to pick Alexis up from the babysitter. She wouldn't have just left her. So that's when her mom knew she's missing. Something serious has gone wrong. It's like she was there one minute and then she was gone. Right from the get-go, I'm thinking somebody had to have taken her. It makes you wonder how many times the person who kidnapped her had done this. He knew the exact right moment to approach a victim. Young mother is missing. Kelly Cox disappeared without a trace. I have to remain optimistic that we're going to find her. I couldn't see her, couldn't find her. I had a bad feeling.

[00:16:11]
Investigators question Laurence Harris yesterday for four hours. Whenever you're dealing with missing persons or any type of homicide investigation, more often than not, it's someone that you know. There's rarely a situation where it's just a true whodunit. It was natural at that time to look into the boyfriend. We all want the same thing. We want her to come home safe. He had been seen in that parking lot. He was sitting there for an extended period of time. They have questioned the boyfriend, and he has passed a lie detector test. He wasn't a good suspect in the case. There are no witnesses. Her boyfriend passes the polygraph, and leads are going nowhere. They really did everything that they possibly could to generate a lead. Even the leads that were coming in, they weren't really fruitful, but no clear-cut concrete evidence about what happened to her. The case eventually went cold. So the days turned into weeks, the weeks into months, months into years. Yes. We always tried to keep the story out there. I wanted people to know it was not a soft case, and Kelly was not home. There's nothing in this world more powerful or compelling than you want to find your child.

[00:17:44]
Eleven days after Kelly Cox went missing, another young woman vanished. Her name was Tiffany Johnston. She was in Oklahoma, about three hours north of Denton. Where How was Tiffany born and raised? She was born in. But she was raised in Anadarko. Anadarko is a little town in Southwestern Oklahoma. Everybody knows everybody. Everybody grows up together, goes to school together, goes to church together. Tiffany was so energetic and daring. Tiffany was my shadow. Everywhere I went, Tiffany went with me. Oh, that's not an idea, honey. That's a fact. Wherever Mama was, Tiffany was going to be there learning how to do something or helping. We went to junior high and high school together. I didn't have friends, and I think she saw that and decided that she was going to be my friend. She just loved life, loved life, and nothing could stop her. Ryan and her dated for about a year. She just had this sixth sense about people. So if she had decided at 19 that he was the one, he was the one. She wanted a big wedding. Big wedding, yes. It cost a lot of money. Yes, I took a job.

[00:19:12]
Yeah. And I made enough to I would fight for it. It was July 26, 1997, the day Tiffany Johnston disappeared from the sunshine car wash here in Bethany, Oklahoma. Alma. That night, she had plans to celebrate her three-month wedding anniversary with her husband. And she stopped at a car wash along the way. And she went missing. It was late at night. Was it normal for people to be washing their cars here that late? Yeah, those were the summer months. And yes, this was a very popular car wash. What happened? What did you see? So about 11:30 PM, I was heading to another call, and I drove by the car wash. There's several occupants still in the car wash, washing. I also observed a white Dodge Neon in the Far West Bay. I continued on to my call, came back about 45 minutes later, and that car was still there, no one around it, and it was the only car still there. When they arrived the second time, they noticed the floor mats were hanging up on the rack, like someone would wash them. The The car was unlocked. The keys were in the ignition. There was money in the console.

[00:20:35]
Payroll check was in the console. So it didn't appear to be a robbery. It just appeared to be whoever drove the car just wasn't there. We did find a phone number to Kathy Dobry, which was Tiffany's mother. And then after midnight, you got a phone call. It was the Bethany Police Department wanting to know if I knew who if need over he was. And I said, Yes, I'm her mother. And they said, Well, we found her car sitting abandoned. Police also contact Ryan, who rushes to the car wash. The husband didn't have any idea where she was and was very concerned. Did you try to call her? Yes. And she didn't answer, and that was something really unusual. Her pager was in in the car, everything. And that was when I really got really scared because she didn't go anywhere without it. In this case, you don't have any physical evidence to go with. And typically, you look at the spouse first. They interviewed him. They checked his alibi. He wasn't working till 11:00 that night. Ryan's work punch card rules him out as a suspect. The thing about this particular crime scene, it didn't appear to be a struggle.

[00:22:01]
It's just that Tiffany wasn't there. We are not sure exactly what happened, but we had concerns that something bad might have happened to Tiffany. The very next day, Tiffany's partially clothved body is found in a tall patch of grass here near the interstate. She had been raped and strangled to death. It was hard to just digest that someone would want to murder her because because everybody that met her liked her. Why would somebody want to murder Tiff? I just lost it because I'm 19. At 19, these things don't happen. I still believed that the world is good and people are good. This particular case, it's really tough. There's no particular witness. There were swaps that came from Tiffany Johnson that the medical examiner collected. Those swaps were taken for DNA analysis, and those results were inconclusive at the time, and at that point, the case went cold. Now, there are three cases Laura and Tiffany found murdered, and Kelly still missing. Handled by three different police departments along the interstate, there's no sense that these cases are linked. Then, four weeks later. A nightmare comes true for some Tiki Island parents. Their 17-year-old daughter has been missing for more than 20 4 hours, and police say this is no runaway.

[00:23:32]

[00:25:04]
There was Laura Smither, just 12 years old, out for a jog near her home in Friendswood, Texas. Then there was a college student and young mother, Kelly Cox, taken near a police station in North Texas. And finally, up in Bethany, Oklahoma, 19-year-old newlywed Tiffany Johnston was last seen at a car wash. And now August brings more heartache back in Texas. Their top story this morning, what could be a nightmare, comes true for some Tiki Island parents. Their 17-year-old daughter has been missing for more than 24 hours, and police say this is no runaway. If you have my daughter and you're through with her, I pray that you would return her because her daddy and I still want her. 17-year-old high school graduate, Jessica Cain, is the only child of Susie and C. H. Cain. What did she mean to you, Jessica? Oh, well, she meant everything in the world. You know, you could lose a limb, an arm, or something, and it'd be easier than doing without your child. Right in the face. She was a parent's dream. She was just as good a child as you could ever want. Say hello to Mr. Rodney, everybody.

[00:26:34]
She did plays in elementary, junior high, high school. And so she'd been at the drama house for two or three years, playing different events. And what were her dreams? What did she want to do? Jessica wanted to study criminology. Her immediate plans were to go to college? Mm-hmm. Did she get to attend one college class? No, she was starting the next week. Tell us about August 1997 and the play she was acting in. She was in a musical, Song for the Fifteen. When we sat down in the audience She grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out of the chair, and we jitterbugged down the aisle to her stage. And what do you remember about her performance that night? How pretty she looked, how excited she was. I went up to tell her how proud I was of her. And the last thing she said to me was, I love you, Daddy. After the play was over with, the cast members went to have dinner at Benningon's Restaurant. She was driving her dad's white Ford pickup truck. Jessica, they saw her going down on the entrance ramp to the freeway. And that was the last thing I saw of Jessica Kay.

[00:28:09]
I had stayed up in the recliner and was waiting up for her, and I dozed off to sleep, and it was about 2:30, I guess, when I woke up and I realized she wasn't here. And that's when I immediately began to panic. She woke me up and I just jumped out of and hit the road looking for her. About two and a half hours after I left the house, I found the truck on the side of the road. It was empty. It was the most horrible feeling you could imagine of emptyness and hurt because I knew that something tragically had happened. There were reports, probably 50, 60 sightings of a white pickup truck being chased by the vehicle, but high speed down the freeway. It was so close to the bumper, it was like it was being towed. We beg you, please, if you know anything, if you can help us in any way, help us find our daughter. Anybody that can spare a little time, we would appreciate you coming out and helping in any way that you possibly can. What did the search for Jessica look like? At one time, I think I was told there were 6,000 responses, and people walking the fields looking for her, and it's all salt grass filled with cotton amounts and rattlesnakes, and beating their way through the brush piles.

[00:29:44]
In the thick areas around the Coast. It was just like deja vu. I mean, thousands of people joined in in the search for Jessica Cain. Incredibly, Laura Smithers' parents, still grieving from the loss of their own daughter, joined the search. She must never give up her hope. There was no question that we had to go help. You said we had to do that. We didn't have to. For us, we had to. We had to give back what people had been so kind to us, and there was no question we had to go find Jessica. It's a nightmare relived. It's very painful. What did Bob and Gay give They gave us their hearts and their love and their support. And the knowledge. They'd already been there. Yeah. They'd already been through it. But as the boxes were boxed and the supplies were shipped Without doubt, volunteers could only fight back tears because Jessica is still missing. This is a let down, but we're going to keep searching. We're going to keep, we're going to find her. In Jessica's case, there was nothing, no leads at all. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

[00:31:07]
I think after Jessica came out missing, that's when people started believing there was a serial killer involved. We were so scared because the thing that we had been afraid of all along, that there was this monster. Jessica Cain is now the fourth young woman who had gone missing. Three in Texas, one in Oklahoma. But what authorities investigating those cases at the time did not know was that there was a fifth young woman taken who escaped. Somebody just came in and said that someone was affected, and they jumped out of the car. Police take the unprecedented step of hypnotizing her. In hopes that she recalls any details before this man strikes again. The desperate search for a twelve-year-old girl in Friendswood is on this afternoon. Kelly Cox disappeared without a trace. Here in the Lamar Tiki Island area, searchers will be searching for 17-year-old Jessica Caine. Families and investigators are puzz. Four young women have gone missing in Texas and Oklahoma, including 12-year-old Laura Smither, who dreamed of being a ballerina. She went running one morning and was found dead three weeks later. But based on our knowledge of the case and evidence recovered at the scene, I am prepared to say that the young lady found is in fact, Laura Kate Smither.

[00:32:43]
At the time, It was terrifying for all of us, for the whole community. While the murder of Little Laura dominated the local news, there was a fifth girl who was taken. But this kidnapping had not received much media attention at the time. On May 17th of 1997, just weeks after Laura Smithers' body is found, a 19-year-old woman is kidnapped in Webster, Texas, mere miles from Friendswood. Sandra Seepal was in a neighboring city in Webster which is immediately adjacent to the city of Friendswood. On the I-45. It's a small city on the I-45 corridor between Houston and Galveston. It's about 1:30 in the morning when 19-year-old Sandra Seepal stops at that convenience store her behind me. She's using a payphone outside, calling a friend, when she notices a strange man parked nearby staring at her. She tells her friend to meet her at this Waffle House across the street. But as she starts driving there, she notices she's got a flat tire. As she pulled into the back of the Waffle House, the unknown person who was watching her across the street at the stop and go had followed her across the street. This individual pulls up beside her and tells her she's got a flat tire and ask her if she would like for him to change it.

[00:34:10]
He looks like a good Samaritan trying to help. Yeah. So like at her we're just a normal cowboy. He opens the hood of his truck and ask her to go to his front seat and get a rag, which she does. He comes up behind her with a large honey knife and puts it to her neck and tells him to get into the truck or he's going to kill her. She gets in the truck. He starts driving north on I-45. He's driving at a high rate of speed. He was holding her down, told her to take off her pants. So it was clear to her that he was going to sexually assault her. She then said, I can't take my pants off because my shoes are off. I have to take my shoes off. So he lets go of her leg, and as soon as he did that, she opened the truck door. She felt like that was her only chance that she was going to be killed one way or the other, and this was her only chance to possibly get away. So she made the decision to jump out of the moving vehicle. Wester 911.

[00:35:26]
Do you all need to come to Waffle House? Somebody They just came in and said that someone was evicted and they jumped out of the car and they're bleeding. Call came over the radio as an aggravated kidnapping. Here's been route to Waffle House. Female jumped out of a white Julie. Unknown LP last seen headed 45 Northbound. She needs an ambulance. She can't walk. As I arrived on scene, I just started gathering as much information as possible. Sandra Sepa had been critically injured, but in spite of that trauma, she was able to recall that her kidnapper was driving a white Ford Deweley truck, and she provided a very basic physical description of the driver. White male under study, blonde hair with a beard. Sandra Sepa is transported to a local hospital where she remains for several days. Had road rash from head to toe, so severe injury to her head that I remember. Her clothes were ripped and torn. Among the evidence collected, the left front tire from the young woman's vehicle. The tire had been punctured, and police note that the puncture looked like it was made with a knife. There was interviews done, but there wasn't anything concrete linking her abduction to any individual.

[00:36:44]
Fearing that there could be a serial rapist on the lose. Investigators bring in a police officer who's trained in hypnosis. It was the very first time this unconventional tool was used by the Webster Police Department. She was so traumatized. There was very little she could recall. As you relax and let go, in the very process of relaxing, you will gradually drift into hypnosis. For more than two hours, they painstakingly go through every detail of the crime. Did he make you feel in trouble? Just ask me. During her hypnosis, I asked her to describe the inside of the vehicle. That half-day is not what happens. What color is that? You have even a picture of it. A statue of a parent. What's the name? She was able to recall some details through the hypnosis and gave a description of the vehicle and the suspect. Incredibly, with the help from the hypnotist, police narrowed their search to one man. He was a predator on the trial, constantly hunting. The predator remains at large, but the hypnosis session proves crucial. In a race against time, police flipped the script. The hunter is now the hunting. Can't allow boys to get in the truck.

[00:38:28]
Get in the truck. He was a predator on the proud, constantly hunting. He started driving until he found someone. Sounds like a monster. We were worried we could be the next one. The entire community was in fear. Yes. There's a killer on the loose. There's a feeding frenzy in this case. The press is all over it. What keeps you going? What allows you to move forward? Catching who did it. There's nothing in this world more powerful or compelling. And you're going to find your child. But one victim escaped and helped find the killer under hypnosis. Just relax. This case has been cold for so long. And there's finally an answer. He just put his hand over to him. All four of them. Wow. So that was one of those, Oh, jeez. What a moment. It was their fault. They did something wrong to annoy him. Okay, if you all would get shoulder to shoulder. You have said you could feel the evil in the room. Why don't you repeat after me in a loud, clear voice? Do not scream. Do not scream. Do not scream. Do not scream. Do not scream. Laura Smithard, just 12 years old, goes missing on April 3, 1997.

[00:40:14]
She's found murdered 17 days later. That July, two other young women go missing farther north, Kelly Cox in Denton, outside of Dallas, and Tiffany Johnston in a suburb of Oklahoma City. Then in August, Jessica Caine disappears off I-45 just north of Galveston. And it's that very same roadway, I-45, that connects these disappearances. In each case, authorities have very little to go on, but they are not giving up. Laura is no longer just a name in Friendswood. It's a battle cry, a battle cry to find a killer. What the public doesn't know is that investigators working on Laura Smithers murder quickly have someone in their sights. Very early on, there was a suspect that was developed.Right from the start.Right from the start. His name was William Reese. William Rees He was a Jack of all trades. He was a truck driver. He operated heavy equipment. He shoot horses. William Reese had a history of kidnapping people. William Reece had been convicted in Oklahoma in the '80s of kidnapping and sexual assault. He was supposed to serve a 25-year sentence. He ended up getting out after nine and a half years of that sentence on an appeal.

[00:41:39]
William Louis Reece was released October 18, 1996 from Oklahoma Department of Corrections. He was working at a construction site next door, essentially, to where Laura's house was. That morning, he was dismissed early from a construction site because the ground was too wet. It had been raining. And drove down the same road that Laura had been out for a jog on. It would have taken William Rees in direct path with Laura Smith the morning of April the third. Well, as soon as they found out that he had kidnapped a female in Oklahoma, a sexually assaulted her. That opened your eyes up pretty quickly. They talked to him, did an interview.Early on?Early on. He consented to a search of his vehicle. They took photographs of the inside of the vehicle, collected fingerprint evidence. They collected fibers from floor mats and seats. The FBI conducted a polygraph test, which was inconclusive. There were other people on the radar earlier that were being looked at closer for a while, but he was the primary suspect. There was reasons not to announce that. Still Behind the scenes, the Friends with Authority is heading up the Smither investigation are willing to discuss their suspect.

[00:43:06]
And that's how a fateful connection between Laura Smithers' case and the Sandra Sapaw kidnapping is made in October, when Sue Patrick Nance, the detective who had hypnotized Sandra, stops by the Friendswood Police Department. I spoke with the chief there, and he told me about who they suspected, and I He left his office, went home, and about three o'clock in the morning, I woke up and I thought, Oh, my God. That's who Sandra Saipal described was William Reese. The suspect was a thin cowboy who wore a cowboy hat. He drove a large white duty pickup truck. There was a notepad or what she thought was some type of notepad or calendar on the dashboard. Sue Dietrich-Nance immediately connects investigators from Friendswood and the neighboring town of Webster, where Sandra was taken. Friendswood Police Department had already processed William Reese's vehicle, so they were able to confirm that his vehicle was consistent with what Sandra Saint Paul had described being the vehicle that had abducted her. They brought Reece in as part of a live lineup. There's a one-way mirror where they come in where Sandra is sitting on the opposite side of the glass. Okay, if you all would get shoulder-shoulder.

[00:44:24]
One after the other after the other. The investigator had each person say phrases that the suspect might have used. Face of glass, won't you repeat after me in a loud, clear voice? Do not scream. Do not scream. Okay, a loud voice. Get in the truck. Get in the truck. A loud voice, I'll kill you, bitch. I'll kill you, bitch. Sandra was able to pick Reese out of the lineup. She recognized him, recognized his voice. Webster police arrested Reese at his home on Fauna Street, Thursday. Detectives say that arrest has almost picture-perfect ties to the Smither case. Just after his arrest for Sandra's kidnapping, friends with authorities publicly name Reese as the prime suspect in Laura Smithers' murder. We are confident That over the weeks ahead, that evidence will link him to our case and lead to what we have all been aiming for, a successful prosecution and conviction. Ultimately, testing does link Reese to Laura's body. There are fibers on her socks that match the floor mats of his truck and a blanket found in his apartment. Unfortunately, the evidence was not enough to convince the Harris County district Attorney's office to file charges in the death of Laura Smith.

[00:45:44]
Were you hopeful that he would be charged? Very hopeful. Laura's murder. Yeah, and then he wasn't. I was angry. I was very angry at that time. But because he was prosecuted for Sandra Sapin, I was very glad about that. There's a feeding I've seen friends in this case. The press is all over. This was a huge case. The seriousness of him also being a possible suspect with Laura Smith was very high profile. Thank you, sir. I'm fairly treated, Mr. Reeve. Yeah, I did. How so? By the press, you're pulling all out. Of course, I didn't do nothing. I didn't know what friends would know, sir. Reeve's whole attitude was so cocky. He's causing Our seventh century, State of Texas versus William, and he was raised. Gaye Smith attended the trial involving Sandra Sapop. She wanted to see this man face to face. That was the only thing I could do to try and hold him accountable. Risa's lawyer is trying to prove that Ries became a suspect in this kidnapping case. Only after it was revealed, he was a suspect in an unrelated murder case, the murder of Laura Smither. The spin is that he's being framed.

[00:46:56]
In the end, the jury takes little more than seven hours to decide Reece's fate. The verdict has just come in. William Reece has been sentenced to 60 years behind bars. Reece said he didn't expect such a long sentence. 60 years? Did that surprise you? Oh, yeah. What did you expect? More leniency. Oh, no. You really didn't expect him to be convicted? He's found guilty, and he's sentenced to 60 years in prison. Did it provide some solace to It did because then we knew he could not hurt anyone else. Is he charged for Laura's murder? No. We became resigned to accepting that he was never going to be held accountable for Laura. And what about the other girls' families? Well, it turns out one of them in Oklahoma knew William Reece. Now, you had a relationship with his mother. Yes. Now streaming only on Disney+. My name is Taylor. Welcome to the Ares Tour. Experience Taylor Swift's record-breaking Ares Tour. Does anyone here know the lyrics? Ruben. Taylor Swift, The Ares Tour, Taylor's version. With four additional acoustic songs. Now streaming only on Disney Plus. What happened to your daughter, Tiffany? She was murdered. She had just gotten married three months before that.

[00:48:54]
It was quite a surprise when they told us that she was missing. Toughest night of your life. It's something that a parent never should have to go through. And for years, you didn't know who did it? No. What keeps you going? What allows you to move forward. Catching who did it. Kathy Dobry, she would not stop pushing investigators. I told Tiffany I would get who murdered That was my promise to her. We were able to actually get the case reopened and get OSBI looking at it again. So when I got this case, there was three or four boxes full of reports, full of information, full of notes that I basically just worked my way through them. It turns out there had been a potential suspect, William Reece. Several months after Tiffany was taken from the Sunshine car wash and raped and murdered, investigators in Oklahoma had gotten a tip from Texas authorities. When Reece was arrested for kidnapping Sandra Sepaw, the woman who got away, he claimed that police were not only trying to frame him for Laura Smithers' death, but that they were also trying to pin Tiffany's murder on him. Without that phone call, William Reece wouldn't had been on our radar screen.

[00:50:31]
That's not a name that the investigators at the time had even heard of. Detectives in Texas also say they can place Reece in Oklahoma the night Tiffany disappeared. Investigators early on developed a timeline with William Reese, using his phone records, his gas receipts, showing what days he traveled up and down I-45 from Houston to Oklahoma. Their phone call had been made from a pay phone the night that Tiffany came up missing, and it was from the Yukon area, which is just west of where Tiffany was reported missing and just east of where her body was located. William Reece immediately becomes a person of interest, but that's the closest investigators could put him to the crime scene. The The car wash owner recognized him as being a customer there at the car wash, but that particular day, there wasn't anyone that could put him there. To be truthful with you, I had no idea what I was I want to do with the case. The only hope I had, there was one item of evidence that with new DNA technology that might be able to be tested. There were some swaps left from the original analysis.

[00:52:02]
That particular evidence had been tested previously and no DNA profile was able to be developed then. And with our current technologies, which are more sensitive, there was hope that we could develop a DNA profile. A partial male DNA profile was obtained from the swaps from Tiffany's body. The partial profile is a huge step forward, but has its limitations. You have to match it to specific samples. I had basically go and eliminate everyone who might have known Tiffany. While OSBI agents are gathering samples in Oklahoma, they reach out to Texas authorities to get a sample from William Reece. And that request gets the attention of investigators in Friendswood, who are starting a cold case review of Laura Smithers' murder. So in 2014, I was tasked with looking into the Laura Smithers case. That's when Josh and I started working together. There was two plans. One, and see if we could develop enough evidence to file charges on William Reece. Second plan was to help Oklahoma develop a strong enough case where their district attorney would file capital murder charges on William Reece, which would be an incentive for him maybe to give up some information in exchange for a life sentence versus was the death penalty.

[00:53:32]
Arned with that timeline of Reece's whereabouts, Friendswood investigators start working together with law enforcement investigating cold cases in places where Reece had visited. In all three cases, Kelly, Jessica, and Tiffany. They were able to find gas receipts, calling cards that put him nearby these locations where the women went missing. Meanwhile, OSBI has tested and eliminated all the other DNA samples they took in Tiffany's case against their partial DNA profile. It was not any of them. So I'm looking at a table full of numbers in each location where the evidence has results. The partial profile was consistent with Reese and nobody else. It's exciting. This case has been cold for so long, and there's finally an answer. In a cruel coincidence, Tiffany Johnston's mother, Kathy, knew William Reece personally. His parents lived across the street from them in Anadarko. Now, you had a relationship with his mother. Yes, his mother did my laundry for me while I was working. She pressed the I suppose that we were going to bury Tiffany in. Do you know if Tiffany knew William Reece? I don't believe Tiffany ever met William Reece. The evidence now suggests that somehow, Reece encountered Tiffany at the Sunshine car wash.

[00:55:02]
That's really when things started moving a lot faster. The amount of information in the partial profile was enough for the DA to file charges. But we purposely waited because we knew that we, Maurice, was not going to get out of prison. The game plan was to allow Texas an opportunity to run their cases. We're all comparing notes, and there wasn't anything missed. There was no new evidence. We're What it was going to come down to was us making a run at William Rees. What's your full name? William Lewis Rees. Yeah. I'm Detective Turbake. At this point in time, we decided to come up with a plan. We lay everything out on a table. To make an offer. To make an offer. I didn't know what to do. I thought, maybe they're going to believe me. William Reece is behind bars in Texas, serving 60 years for kidnapping Sandra Sepau. Now, with the threat of a death penalty case for Tiffany Johnston's murder in Oklahoma looming over him, law enforcement in Texas decide to approach Reece to see if he will cooperate with their cases on Laura Smither, Kelly Cox, and Jessica Caine. My experience with suspects is if you can make them a good offer or a better offer than what they're about to receive, they usually take There may be consideration if he's willing to give up the locations of the remaining girls.

[00:56:37]
Originally, I always felt I was going to do the interview, right? The issue we had in all of that, William Reece hated Friendswood Police Department. That's right. So we had to come up with something else. Doug Bacon and I discussed who we'd like to use to make a run at William Reece. Reece was a cowboy, right? We felt that he could relate to another cowboy, which there's No more of a cowboy in Texas than a Texas Ranger. Jim Holland, the Texas Rangers, February ninth, 2016 at the LS unit, Huntsville, Texas. Time is now 2:46. We knew Jim Holland was a very good interviewer, so we recruited him to come on board. Bill? Yes, sir. Jim Holland, 3. What do you think this is about? It's probably about some murder cases. Which one? Is any clear? I have no idea. Okay, Well, we've got you on the case, and we've got you on the surface. But it doesn't have to be all bad, all right? Roger. Roger. Roger. Roger. Roger I'm not going to promise you things, but for at least a little bit of time, if you help me, you can get treated like Rockstar.

[00:57:53]
I think they tried to make him feel like he was one of the boys. Hey, we want your help with this. This is a very unique opportunity for you, and there is a thing called consideration, and there's things that you can do in guarantees in advance. Holland interviewed him for five and a half hours. I think at the end of the day, Phil is going to make a decision based on what's best I'm going to ask for a bill. Okay, what do we do? There's a clock ticket. We provided Jim Holland with photographs of all of those girls. At some point in time, he had laid the pictures of Jessica Caine, Laura Smith, Kelly Cox, and Johnson. What do you want me to say? Tell me. Do you want me to go to the DA and broach it to get you a guarantee? Tell me what? Get me in and tell me when to go. All right. If you come back Monday, I'll tell you, either we're going to do this or I ain't going to do it. Okay. Why don't you talk about all this? All four. He just put his hand over and said, All four of them.

[00:58:54]
Wow. So that was one of those, Oh, jeez. He has given some indication that he was responsible for the murders of all four of these girls. Susie had been praying that exact thing just previously. All the families, we all talk to law enforcement. Bringing those two girls was very important to us. We'd taken the death Is he off the table. We okayed that. I said, If in fact, he takes you to where he buried Kelly and we can get her remains, that's fine. When Ranger Holland returns to meet Reese as agreed, Oklahoma is making any promises. They had not made a decision one way or the other, whether they would or they wouldn't pursue the death penalty. Although Reese is initially reluctant, he still agrees to give up the location of one of the missing women as a first step. At the end of the day, you don't have one chip. You've got two chips. Right. Okay. So you want one of them? Yeah. How can you want one? William Reece was released into Friinswood Police Department's custody. We first drove him. We said, That he buried Kelly Cox. This is the site out in Brazzoria County, off at 288 County Road 51.

[01:00:07]
Why did he choose this spot to bury her? There was a stolen bulldozer on site. So he had already had a bulldozer staged here that he was hiding out until he could sell it. That he had stolen. That's correct. As investigators begin to dig where Reece directs them, he settles into his own cell at the Friendswood Jail. So you get him to open up to you by appearing to be friendly with him. Correct. As an investigator, you have to play a role, right? But you always knew what he did. But your intention was to get information from him. That was my intention. Within three days, he was telling me about the murders of the four girls. Over the course of several taped interviews, Reece shares details on how he murdered each young woman, starting with 12-year-old Laura Smither, who was out jogging. I heard this loud noise. I hit something, I thought it was some mailboxes. So my mirror slung up against the side of my truck, near the road. So I stopped. This one's sitting in a ditch. I don't know what to do. I thought, Man, they're not going to believe me. According to him, it was an accident.

[01:01:26]
I flew upside in the building. Reece says he ran into that young mother, Kelly Cox, at the convenience store near the Denton Police Station. She bumped into him walking out the store with a Coke in her hand and called her the drunk. We got into it there, and she hit him with that Coke. It was It was a plastic bottle. It was on. When I hit her, she hit her head. With a Jessica Caine, she was coming out of Bennington's, getting in her car, and she bumped his car door, and he yelled at her, and she flipped him off. He left that parking lot driving down south toward Galston, and Jessica Caine just happened to be driving behind him. So he said he pulls off the side of the highway. She just pulled right up behind me for no reason. She shouldn't get going, but she didn't. She was yelling at me. Then I lost it. I just got it, and I went over there and hit her. Right there on the interstate, cars were going by and everything. So I asked Ries to be willing to give me a statement concerning the Tiffany Johnson case, and he agreed.

[01:02:26]
He said he was at a car wash with his horse trigger. I spread him between the truck and the trailer. Next thing I know, this girl is yelling at me that I sprayed her. I don't think I sprayed her, but she was cussing and everything. We started getting into verbal words back and forth. You threw her in a horse trailer where after a more physical confrontation, you wrapped a rope around her neck and strung her to death. I remember her being on top of me. I told her to get off because it was too hot in there, I couldn't do it. She hit me in the back of the head with that horse shit. Let's back up just a little bit because you just lost me. You claimed that he grabbed her with a beat on her, was beaten donor, and suddenly she wants to have sex with him. The part that's hard to believe is that you guys start out with a fight, and suddenly, you need to have sex with you. I ain't saying she was doing it voluntarily. We have reason never, never admitted to being in the wrong. He always had an excuse for what he did.

[01:03:36]
It wasn't his fault. It was their fault. And I don't think normal people like you and I can even begin to understand the mindset of somebody like that. You know he's not telling the truth. You know he's lying to you. But you don't want to push him too hard because you don't want to lose his cooperation. After days of digging, investigators are starting to doubt his word, especially his story about where he buried Kelly Cox. We dug for seven days and did not locate anything. We let him know that folks are starting to lose confidence in what he's telling us. I'd like to see the concern on his face. Because his life depended on it. I'm telling you, she's got to be out here somewhere. Eventually, Reece will take police to a second location where he says he buried the other missing woman. I still don't understand why we can't find her. With the threat of the death penalty hanging over his head and seven days of digging without finding Kelly Cox, William Reece assures investigators he can bring them to where he buried Jessica Caine. Can you tell us the truth about burying her out, sir?

[01:05:03]
Yes, sir. Why? I don't I understand? Reece said, Hey, I'll take you directly to Jessica Caine's location because I know where I buried her because it's right by our pipeline. Reece had drawn by hand a map for these investigators of where he buried the body. We start digging with shovels, and that quickly turned into some excavation equipment that we start getting when we realized that we're not going to find the remains immediately. Thirteen Eye Witness news was first on scene and captured this exclusive video of William Rees. He's still in police custody, but has been brought out to the site to help find Jessica Cain. He had handcuffs. Just calmly walking around. He would speak with investigators. He would point at the ground. Two massive excavators have been moving all day, digging more than 6 feet into ground. Investigators are keeping a close eye on the dirt falling from the buckets, looking for anything out of the ordinary. All of these agencies had descended on this strip of land. This has now become an enormous operation. Time, money, manpower. The activity has not slowed down more than one week into the digging process. Some days it would be cold, mosquitoes, a lot of snakes, really pretty miserable.

[01:06:30]
But everybody that was there knew that they were there to find Jessica. I've prayed for this child for years and years, and just hoping that upon hope that this is it. There were friends who had come up to the dig site. They had tied ribbons around the fence. Everyone was really just hoping that after all of this time, there would be some answers. But This land, of course, has changed over the years. He thought that he had buried her over here, but he had his fence lines confused. He thought he had buried her along this fence line, but he actually had buried her along this fence line. Correct. After a total of three weeks digging at this remote site, investigators discovered human remains. Investigators believe those remains belong to 17 old Jessica came. Once we saw the bones, we took pictures of that and sent it to an anthropologist to confirm that that was human remains. It was a lot of emotions with everyone that had been involved, the weight that was on everyone's shoulders. The initial shock at first of her not coming home and anticipating that any moment she is going to walk through the door.

[01:07:57]
I think those years were harder. As it went on, I think we had accepted whatever God had in store for us. For thine is the Kingdom and the power. Because our faith had grown stronger. You learn so much through trials. And that's why I think the closure, when it came, was a little harder on everybody else, maybe than us, because we'd already accepted whatever God's answer was. Reece immediately said, Now that everyone knows that I'm serious, we need to go back to Presoria County and find the other one. Kelly Cox, the mother of a one-year-old, went missing in 1997. We were out there for several days. The area just past the trees is ground zero for digging operations. What these grounds hold is still a mystery. They were raising the bucket up, and there was just a little cylindrical piece of something. So we just had to stop. And it was a small bone fragment. And I was down in the trench on my hands and knees. So I dig a little bit more and I see something metallic. It looks like gold. And I remember Jan telling me about a chain that Kelly wore, and I knew then that this was Kelly.

[01:09:29]
She always wore it. She never took it off. She just left it on. And they brought it to you. Yes, they brought it to the house. It's very important to me. It still gives me goosebumps thinking about it because that was Alexis's mom. It felt cathartic to look at the ground and say, I'm so sorry, but we found you. She did not deserve to be there in the ground where she was found. There was a sense of relief knowing that we had found her for the family. Almost 20 years. Yeah. I had nightmares for years that she was in some sex trafficking ring or something being harmed every day. When we did have answers, it It was comforting for me to know that she wasn't being harmed. She had been in God's arms since July 15, 1997. Now that Jessica and Kelly have been found, Reece is extradited back to Oklahoma to stand trial for the murder of Tiffany Johnston. State of Oklahoma versus William Louis Reece. You have said you could feel the evil in the room. I would love to just get up and just wait a little. Has the jury reached a verdict?

[01:11:13]
It had been nearly 25 years since Tiffany Johnston went missing at a car wash in Oklahoma, her body found strangled to death the next day. You have said you never thought William Reece would be brought to justice. Why not? We didn't have really any hope. But the long wait is finally over. In May 2021, William Reece goes on trial for the murder of Tiffany Johnston. And then finally, you see him in court. What was that like? Well, they made me promise to behave, but I was angry. I would have loved to just get up and just wait a bit. And I would have felt a lot better, but I'd get kicked out of the courtroom, and I didn't want to get kicked out because I'd waited too long to get there. Reece She's on trial for Tiffany Johnston's murder. But family and friends of all the victims come to court to witness what they hope will finally be long-awaited justice. To walk with Laura through Tiffany, that was important to me. It's all I had left. You have said you could feel the evil in the room. Absolutely. And that's exactly how it was. It was like a presence of its own.

[01:12:44]
It was eerie, almost. What was his demeanor like? He was stoic. He didn't show any emotion. Among the witnesses, Risa's previous victims, including Sandra Sepau, the 19-year woman he kidnapped at a Waffle House who escaped by jumping out of his moving truck. A whole bunch of victims were paraded before the jury, telling their story of what he did to them. They were extremely courageous young women getting up and testifying. What impact did they have, their testimony? A huge impact. The prosecution brings up that partial DNA link to Tiffany and also plays for jury hours of taped interviews with Reece, allowing them to hear in his own words what he said happened not only to Tiffany Johnston, but also to Laura Smith, Kelly Cox, and Jessica Caine. I'm not going to lie to you. It's over with. I don't want this to be over with. The defense argued that those statements weren't confessions because he was telling detectives what they wanted to hear in an effort to take the death penalty off the table. That's it. That's all. Hang in one second. I'm going to be right back. Okay. The prosecution counters that Reece was well aware that there was no deal with Oklahoma, playing an audio interview recorded during a search for Kelly Cox, which they said proved Reece knew that there was no deal.

[01:14:16]
If they say they don't want a deal, let them give me the needle. Look, man, I don't got no family last, so it really don't bother me now. After eight days of testimony, it took the jury less than one hour to arrive at a verdict. We, the jury, do upon our oaths find as follows. The defendant is guilty. What happened there was extraordinary in many ways, because I think that trial was also a trial for all of the girls. That conviction in that trial was really for all the girls. Five days after the guilty verdict, William Reece is back in court for sentencing. We are on the record, State of Oklahoma versus William Louis Reece. A death sentence is not something to be celebrated. It is not something to be taken lightly, and it is not something to be utilized on a win. You have been solidly behind giving William Reece the death penalty. Why does he deserve the death penalty? According to the Bible, it's I 4:9. I believe that. I wanted to see him get sentenced, and I wanted to make sure that the judge didn't You have all these nightmares. Can they change the sentence and pull it away and not do it?

[01:15:50]
I wanted to hear those words. There's an old saying in the law, justice delayed is justice denied. Justice will not be delayed any longer in this case. I sentence you to death. He's a monster, and he's a sex offender. Murder, and he's a liar, and he's a murderer. Now a convicted murderer sentenced to death. But what about his other victims? Would Will those families ever get their day in court and justice for their own losses? State of Oklahoma versus William Louis Reece. Mr. Reece, I sentence you to death. William Reece is currently in a Texas prison. He was sentenced to 60 years for Sandra Sabos kidnapping and the death penalty in Oklahoma for killing Tiffany Johnston. How do you claim, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Reece pleads guilty to three separate counts of murder, life for each case in the murders of Laura Smither, Jessica Caine, and Kelly Cox. Hearing Reece plead guilty, I knew what it meant to the families. He indicated in a courtroom in front of the judge and the families that he would be responsible for their death. I told him in my victim impact statement that I forgave him. I was in a prison that I placed myself in because I was so angry at him, and I had to find my way out of that prison of anger by forgiving him.

[01:17:46]
As much as we'd like to rely on our justice system, you can't rely on the justice system for peace. I had a picture of Kelly and Alexis. We held up the entire time for him to look at. I wanted him to see that he had not ruined or destroyed our family, that I still had a great childhood, and I still grew up happy, and I was still raised really well. This is the statue. This is it. Kelly holding Alexis, and we did a big balloon release at her life's celebration, so we put balloons with it. If I could say anything to you personally, it would be stay aware, stay safe, and God bless Kelly. I miss you. I think about you every day. Every day. It gives me peace for coming out. It's my peaceful place. It's no confusion or anything. It's just being here with Tiff by myself. If you could talk to her, what would you tell her? That I love her and I miss her, and she should be here with us. It's been almost 27 years. How often do you think of her? Every day. When you love, that love doesn't just die after you've buried your child.

[01:19:29]
That love stays with you. It'll be with you. It is our life sentence. We will carry that with us always. Jessica Caine's parents hold on to memories of happier times. On a dead night out, I took her in the Baytown to a movie, and on the way home, they played a song that I loved, and it was by the Platters, Only You. Only And so I just pulled off on the side of the highway, Interstate 10, and it was dark, no traffic, and she put her feet on my toes, and we just danced around under her. What a beautiful memory. Yes, it is. What's the moral of the story? Teach your children well. And dance when you can dance. And dance when you can dance. The families we spoke with telling us, David, they're sharing their pain and their memories as a warning to try to protect others from experiencing the same heartbreak. And we should know note tonight, Deborah, that William Reece is appealing his conviction and death sentence in Oklahoma. That is our program for tonight. Thanks for watching. I'm David Muir. I'm Deborah Roberts. From all of us here at 20/20 and ABC News, good night.

June Diane Raphael  02:16

Now Jes, we’re heating a call that no one has made.

 

Jessica St. Clair  02:20

Not a soul.

 

June Diane Raphael  02:21

But you’re invited to listen.

June Diane Raphael  02:40

Hi, Jessica.

 

Jessica St. Clair  02:42

Hello, June.

 

June Diane Raphael  02:45

How are you? What is going on?

 

Jessica St. Clair  02:48

I got COVID and my child sick. She doesn’t have COVID, just another cold.

 

June Diane Raphael  02:57

I’m so confused.

 

Jessica St. Clair  03:00

Me too, turns out when I was talking about my low energy levels last week, it was because I was avec COVID and I didn’t realize it, so here we are.

 

June Diane Raphael  03:18

Here we are, so to face a couple.

 

Jessica St. Clair  03:23

I don’t even know at this point and this is not a medical podcast, but like do you I thought they just lifted the quarantines. I don’t know man, you know, honestly, does anyone really let us out of our homes during the day anyway? It’s like where am I going?

 

June Diane Raphael  03:39

Right?

 

Jessica St. Clair  03:40

I wasn’t asked to the Vanity Fair Oscar party.

 

June Diane Raphael  03:43

Right.

 

Jessica St. Clair  03:45

But yeah, you know it is, I wish honestly I’d known earlier so I could have like you got empathy talked about it more gotten out of more things you know hold but.

 

June Diane Raphael  04:02

That’s when it’s like to not be able to use it for its greater good, you know, is a really upsetting.

 

Jessica St. Clair  04:10

Quarantine, like, I would have been over in that GC by myself. But by the time I realized that the damage was done.

 

June Diane Raphael  04:16

Right, we’ve already done all of our exposure.

 

Jessica St. Clair  04:20

Imagine if I was over there. I would have been de couponing right now I would have been like, living my best. Oh god this I wouldn’t be stenciling I would have gotten out stencils.

 

June Diane Raphael  04:31

Oh my God, Jess, I’m sorry […] You’re not feeling well.

 

Jessica St. Clair  04:37

No, I’m actually okay now. I think I realized at the tail end of it. I don’t know guy.

 

June Diane Raphael  04:43

Well, I am you know, it’s was shocking to get the text that you had COVID on know what to do. It was just like interesting […]. I it’s so weird, like I have actually been processing a lot of delayed COVID grief. And this podcast is a COVID response podcast. It’s endemic response. We’re on the frontline, you know, it is a pandemic, it’s like it is an absolute response backlash on what you want to call it to the pandemic.

 

Jessica St. Clair  05:16

It’s true actually, so much of our podcast is motivated by member, the first couple episodes, you talked about wanting to go to a fuck cut.

 

June Diane Raphael  05:27

I know and I never got to.

 

Jessica St. Clair  05:29

I think that’s out of the cards for us, unfortunately. Even though so many people we know are doing Strato work.

 

June Diane Raphael  05:37

I know, and I you know, the fuck hut of my dreams for all of those new listeners was like, I was feeling so crazy and so isolated, like so isolated, that I did want us to all do a bunch of drugs. And when I say us, I do mean, everyone.

 

Jessica St. Clair  05:56

Yeah, as a collective as an idea. And I think that would have been a right response.

 

June Diane Raphael  06:02

And I wanted I wanted it.

 

Jessica St. Clair  06:03

For adults.

 

June Diane Raphael  06:05

Obviously, a hot where we could all do but like a beautifully designed hut, where we would all do mushrooms and the like nothing that’s like potentially going to be laced with fentanyl, like no.

 

Jessica St. Clair  06:19

Nothing that’s going to make us render us insane for.

 

June Diane Raphael  06:22

No, just like a real you know, mushrooms. Stuff that grows in the ground. And then we would walk in and.

 

Jessica St. Clair  06:32

Covered in sheepskin, it would be covered in like animal I know that you’re vegan, of course, but different animal skins. You know, it should feel like Game of Thrones in a way in a way.

 

June Diane Raphael  06:44

So then we would all and we, is.

 

Jessica St. Clair  06:48

Like I don’t know is in we.

 

June Diane Raphael  06:51

But you’d you’d have sex with whoever was there. Okay, a man woman doesn’t matter.

 

Jessica St. Clair  07:00

Okay, you’re saying hi.

 

June Diane Raphael  07:02

This out and you get out putting away. And then this is what’s so important is that you walk out. And whatever has happened inside there. Maybe you find a new partner who knows but what happens in the fuck 1,000%, and then you walk out and you’re just a little bit more resolved your little bit. You’ve healed a little bit. And yeah, that’s my you know, that’s my big. Oh my god, I have to tell you this is so so upsetting, but I.

 

Jessica St. Clair  07:39

So I do feel like I’m having some delayed because we have no rituals because we we barely have any healing around this. It’s just like, you know, million we have I don’t know what the fuck is going on? And we haven’t been out on the pickleball court and so long and that was a real touchstone for me. And I think that children have ruined that obviously for us, you know, their their activities have taken away more joy from us than from the little that was left. And so that’s a bummer. You know that either bummer.

 

June Diane Raphael  08:14

That was another healing space.

 

Jessica St. Clair  08:17

It was, no for real.

 

June Diane Raphael  08:21

So my so so yeah, so there’s been like some delayed grief for me but also like thinking about that time you know, like Gus said something in their day where he’s like, he said something about certain homework and he was like, yeah, it was during COVID when we were in Canada, and I was like, that was like Tony, that literally like don’t even mention that the fact that you have a memory of that is so disturbing to me.

 

Jessica St. Clair  08:50

They do.

 

June Diane Raphael  08:51

Or dark days. I also wanted to share with you that something major has happened deep divers and I’m excited to announce it to Jessica, my family doesn’t know the children don’t know this yet boy decided yesterday that we are officially adopting Bingo.

 

Jessica St. Clair  09:13

Oh, I’ve been waiting for this news. You keep saying Foster and every time it’s like you don’t wait for the Academy. We need to have a ceremony of some sort to welcome him to the academy, sash around.

 

June Diane Raphael  09:31

Listen, I’m all about creating ritual create making meaning making meaning and so yes, I think I think something needs to be done thank you, Jessica. I’m so excited to tell the kids Paul’s been away when it comes back or until the kids oh, here’s what’s interesting now. For those of you new listeners who don’t remember my other dog Meatball, please know that Meatball told us in no uncertain terms. When it was time for him to go, right, okay.

 

Jessica St. Clair  10:04

He was ready to stand down. Sergeant meatball was his full name.

 

June Diane Raphael  10:08

That’s right. A member of the armed forces, yeah. And the way he did it, so I’ve been working on our backyard, which had like, finally took on as a concept as a place like, yeah, I needed to deal with.

 

Jessica St. Clair  10:23

Dirt pit for a while

 

June Diane Raphael  10:24

it was a pit that was yet so. So once it was done, actually, we put a pool in once everything was done. And it’s a tiered backyard. So like you had to go down and Meatball was already struggling with stairs. And once we were as a family in that pool, and he saw us down there in the pool together, that was the day that he walked away.

 

Jessica St. Clair  10:51

The first time he’s ever walked away from his post.

 

June Diane Raphael  10:54

Oh, he’s never left this house. I mean, I told the story before but I, you know, the one time that like the gate was open, we would leave the backyard gate open. He’d never ever leave. But one time, the gate was open. He couldn’t find us. And he I panicked because I couldn’t find him. And I started run out the front door. The motherfucker was sitting at the door. Yeah, that’s right and lying down in front of him. And he walked away. So he wasn’t going anywhere. Except for that day. He saw us there, and all the gates, I didn’t. I thought all the gates were open but again, this dog never left. And all of a sudden, you know, half an hour later a woman comes running into the backyard saying like, do you have a dog and english bulldog? He’s like two blocks away. Okay, so that was my sign that he was trying to find like a Viking. It was like a Viking General. Okay, they just walk. They just sail away when it’s their time.

 

Jessica St. Clair  11:56

Yeah, that’s right.

 

June Diane Raphael  11:57

They don’t want to be a burden to the community. A lot of Native American tribes do this as well. They just sort of the elders walk out.

 

Jessica St. Clair  12:06

Yeah.

 

June Diane Raphael  12:09

And Meatball left, and so yesterday, it’s like Bingos been such a Bingos been in that backyard so much, he’s such as he’s it’s his space, you know, we’re down there we’re playing is playing another dogs he’s, it’s his domain. And I started to think back on that moment of Meatball looking at us and I think he saw those steps you know, down because of course, we have stepped down to the first level of backyard we have steps in our house we have steps in and then we were craving stuff second level. And I think he saw them and said, no.

 

Jessica St. Clair  12:54

That’s a […] dogs game.

 

June Diane Raphael  12:55

It’s yeah, and I’ve just felt so I’ve been thinking about him so much, just this is the thing about grief right? It’s like, you think you’re done or you think you’re like oh, I’m resolved and then to be taken all I have been thinking every time I’m down there with Bingo I pictures face through the slats of the fence looking down at us. And I’m just like, and then I felt so badly oh my god, I’m sorry. We didn’t have a way for you to get down here like I just.

 

Jessica St. Clair  13:33

Know you’re really it’s so interesting how the brain like tries to find like some reason why you’re sad. It’s like no, I’m just I yeah, I miss it. You know, you miss him. Think about when you cross over how all the all the psychics and mediums say the same thing that is who greets you. All not just psychics and mediums my friend but hospice nurses who have witnessed 1000s of death.

 

June Diane Raphael  13:59

What?

 

Jessica St. Clair  14:00

You didn’t know that?

 

June Diane Raphael  14:01

No.

 

Jessica St. Clair  14:01

Hospice nurses hospital.

 

June Diane Raphael  14:03

What did they say?

 

Jessica St. Clair  14:05

They say that there’s I felt, you know, I follow mainly.

 

June Diane Raphael  14:09

Yeah, of course.

 

Jessica St. Clair  14:10

Like, that’s why that’s where my algorithms that and there’s just I mean, hospice care. I mean, they’re just such wonderful people. And, but this one woman hospice nurse, Penny, talks about how there will the process of dying in general and she tries to destigmatize it and like things that are very natural that happen and, you know, the family is sometimes like, you shouldn’t you know, they’re diabetic, should they should they have ice cream? And she’s like, yeah, they should have fucking whatever they want, you know, and how actually, like, the body’s primed to become dehydrated, you know, and it’s, it’s very, very fascinating and, you know, and, but one of the things and how, like, there’s often this final rally that happens where read before the body really does let go. But she talks about how many people are greeted by their pets. And so they will be looking up and see they’ll have visions of their pets coming for them before they die, this is documented this, like me, I swear that their pets their comfort items, I can’t first matters to show up to walk them through.

 

June Diane Raphael  15:35

Like I can’t imagine anything better.

 

Jessica St. Clair  15:38

Truly, truly.

 

June Diane Raphael  15:41

And then you think about them being angels on this earth. And that’s what they are. They’re pure love bombs. That’s all they are. I know they’re they all they do is make us happy.

 

Jessica St. Clair  16:00

They know dopamine. I mean, I can’t. Well, I’m coming over Bebe and I are coming over with Cookie now that it’s official. And Bingo can meet you know, her. Her niece, her cousin, second cousin from the west side.

 

June Diane Raphael  16:18

So funny, Bingo has been misgendered left and right. It’s so unknown to me.

 

Jessica St. Clair  16:24

I know.

 

June Diane Raphael  16:25

Nobody ever Mr. Know or a lady.

 

Jessica St. Clair  16:29

But bingo has a feminine and masculine energy and it is. It’s a masculine battle, like the masculine. Yeah, he’s really, he’s really bored, the Gen Z. He’s like, whatever is below that.

 

June Diane Raphael  16:44

That’s him saying he’s a new manifestation of gender that we have yet to understand. We’re going to know where to fucking god just because this dog has, you know, he has one pale blue eye and one brown eye. There’s something about he’s, he’s holding both. He’s both sides now.

 

Jessica St. Clair  17:05

Like seal, you know, he’s like, the artists seal. And he’s always wearing a jaunty scarf. You know, I just like, I don’t know, who’s putting those scarfs on him. But you know, it’s really something and he’s so cute. And I’m just so happy for your family. And you know, the other thing that is just so wild about pets is they all have such different personalities. So to go from an old dog to a young energy is a wild thing and it’s but it’s also renewal in spring and.

 

June Diane Raphael  17:37

Can I tell you something, Jess, and I’m sorry, I’m sorry our deep divers it Bingo is now in the background wanting to play so badly. So please excuse the noise but what’s so interesting. Oh, did you see that? I tried to throw something in it hit the wall. So what’s so interesting is that my sister’s jog Otto who was about four but he was a puppy puppy like pup, puppy, and he you know, Meatball was always an elder statesman with him. And meatball, really, you know, taught him how to behave a few times. And that tablished his boundaries. And so like when Otto is in the house, I don’t want to play so badly with me bone was so interested. And Meatball would just be like, you know, that’s not for me. I just like your children. You didn’t like playing?

 

June Diane Raphael  18:34

I don’t play.

 

June Diane Raphael  18:36

I don’t and I stand fucking behind that.

 

June Diane Raphael  18:38

For our new listeners, Jude doesn’t play.

 

June Diane Raphael  18:41

I don’t play with children. I’m an adult […].

 

Jessica St. Clair  18:45

But that maybe […] you so much as she always says June speaks to me like I am an adult and I appreciate that because she feels that she is one already just know she said I really appreciate it June speaks to me as an adult. When you weigh on in her in on her outfits is as if you you know you’re at the Vanity Fair party saying love what is this designer?

 

June Diane Raphael  19:06

Well, I also do think Jess, I mean I think that I’m really there’s certain things I play I play a card game I’ll actually do Legos and I will play sports. But I don’t you’re not going to find me like, let’s sit here and draw together or lead leave me.  I get paid to do that okay, that should doesn’t come for free. Hold on one second, let me occupy him with something I’ll be right back, okay.

 

June Diane Raphael  22:46

Jess?

 

Jessica St. Clair  22:47

Yes?

 

June Diane Raphael  22:47

I’m so sorry for like I’ve been talking just nonstop and I’m going to be done with this but I just want to tell you one other thing exciting but it’s also yes you’re right it is the circle of life because because now so my dog nephew Otto he’s always sort of Meatball was always was always letting him know what time it was, and then yesterday because I knew it adopted him I said let’s bring it over let’s have a playdate and bingo I wanted to play with so badly with Otto.

 

Jessica St. Clair  23:28

Otto had to tell him what time it was.

 

June Diane Raphael  23:30

When he did and I was like holy shit it and I know the divers I’m sorry if this is all so insanely, but it really blew my mind, I was like, if that’s not the circle of life, my life’s a circle.

 

Jessica St. Clair  23:48

Joni says Deborah Terry […]

 

June Diane Raphael  23:53

Days keep going round […] Okay, I don’t want to, but it really, really, like really affected me really impacted me. I was like, what am I witnessing? Because Otto was always the puppy energy in the playful. And then honestly, what what I have really had to confront was how sad I was for Bingo that he would play with him pathetic.

 

Jessica St. Clair  24:23

Well, it’s just like when I brought cookie down to you know, there’s a cocktail hour that happens for the small dogs in Santa Monica and they all go down and run free, even though it’s illegal. And you know, Cookie has a hard time because she’s preyed upon by most of the male dogs and so she was trying to keep her butthole firmly on the ground. And then they were getting into her ear select they’ll try to get any you know, anything they can from her. Yeah, and I don’t know why she’s such catnip,

 

June Diane Raphael  24:54

But you know, just it’s just I don’t know that I’ve ever felt to see Bingo. got rejected and what I will give him and as interesting to watch as my brother in law said he’s like, this is just like they’re talking to each other they are this is my language. And I was like, absolutely. I can’t I’m not a dog, I’m not I loved animals. I am not I didn’t grow up with this.

 

Jessica St. Clair  25:17

Shouldn’t be anything in your life. This shouldn’t be a part of your personality and yet it is now.

 

June Diane Raphael  25:24

It is, Jess, I don’t know, did you? Did you grow up with animals?

 

Jessica St. Clair  25:29

No, it was a cat family.

 

June Diane Raphael  25:31

Oh, I didn’t know that.

 

Jessica St. Clair  25:34

Two cats always. And now they’re named after my. They’re always named weirdly after my my grandfather had a cat named after himself. And now we have a cat. They have a cat named after him as well.

 

June Diane Raphael  25:53

It was so weird, are you a cat person?

 

Jessica St. Clair  25:56

Yes, I do love cats and I did spend I’ve spent many weekends at the cat cafe Yes, I was originally a cat person. It was this it was the only animal I could get my hands on and I and yes and I love them and and we have one of our deep divers has a beautiful rescue called sorry, the Caddyshack and she says she sends BB lots of merch and but yes, but does it isn’t that strange that my grandfather named a cat after himself at Thomas our kitty cat. […]

 

June Diane Raphael  26:33

About us just like passing on his legacy.

 

Jessica St. Clair  26:36

That’s strange. It’s strange as hell in our herd. Then we named it after that. Uh huh.

 

June Diane Raphael  26:42

Can I tell you I had an experience with a cat this weekend that left me rattled.

 

Jessica St. Clair  26:49

What?

 

June Diane Raphael  26:51

So I this is so complicated, and again for our new deep divers. I really apologize today’s an animal podcast. It is an animal episode. So I had fostered a different Pitbull, you know who I’m talking about?

 

Jessica St. Clair  27:07

Hipple?

 

June Diane Raphael  27:08

Who won that got away in the witness protection program? Yeah, and I was fostering the softball for one of my best friends. We had her for a month and a half. We all were really in love with her.

 

Jessica St. Clair  27:23

The good old days

 

June Diane Raphael  27:25

As my son would say those were the good old days. So it was very hard to let her go. But it was beautiful, too. So we went this weekend. Me and the boys we drove to San Diego on Saturday morning to go visit both my best friend her wife and their dog, that we had we had spend time with now. I forgot I was almost halfway there. And I thought they have two cats. And I didn’t have any clarity, I’m really allergic to cats. Okay, so it’s not like I don’t like cats, I can’t like cat. It’s available to me, they hurt me cat’s great.

 

Jessica St. Clair  28:09

Yes.

 

June Diane Raphael  28:11

So I really didn’t declare it and I said, man, you gotta go out and get some and she’s like, okay, okay. And the other issue I was like, I swear to you Jess, every cat I encounter wants to be with me.

 

Jessica St. Clair  28:23

Yeah, they know the ones that don’t like them and then they have to make it their business […] Exactly they get you do have an interest in cat energy. Now that you know you don’t like me, I’ll spend my whole life trying to get you to like, that’s my MO.

 

June Diane Raphael  28:43

So I arrived now their house is beautiful, right by the ocean ocean breeze, I’m like, I walk in. I’m like, oh, actually, I’m okay. I’m gonna took a clarinet, but I was like, this isn’t as bad. Not a lot of carpets. I’m like, I’m okay, and I see the cats. And we’re staying over there. And I’m like, okay, like they don’t announce like they’re not interested in humans at all. And I’m like, okay. So we go through the day or out and about we have a beautiful dinner at the house. I’m fine. Cats are not anywhere near us. Okay, then, it’s time to go to bed. Now Gus is also allergic to cats. Okay, that’s a part of this, also on clarinet. And when I tell you this cat, whose name I couldn’t I still don’t know because I just couldn’t commit it to memory. This large black cat was so heavy. Okay, I’ve never seen such a heavy cat.

 

Jessica St. Clair  29:43

Well, now you’re fat shaming this cat.

 

June Diane Raphael  29:44

I’m sorry.

 

Jessica St. Clair  29:45

It’s not right.

 

June Diane Raphael  29:46

It was just heavy to the ground. Big, thick, thick presence. So I go to sleep with both kids in the bed with me, doors closed. Then I meant I wanted to come out and do some more time with my friend but I actually fell asleep with the kids that I wake up. It’s like, one of the morning and I’m like, Oh God, I gotta do my skincare gotta do my stuff. Now I walk out. I walk out of the room. That motherfucker. It’s sitting in the middle of the hallway staring at me. And I’m like, oh.

 

Jessica St. Clair  30:27

Because that’s when they come to life, they’re not. Okay, I want to talk about the fact that they’re nocturnal.

 

June Diane Raphael  30:33

[…] That I just understood that this weekend. Yeah, so hunt […]

 

Jessica St. Clair  30:41

Was raising you stalking you.

 

June Diane Raphael  30:43

Okay, so I’m like, Oh, God, but the bathroom is right there. So I just I don’t even have to go past him. I just go right into the bathroom. I close the door, do my stuff. I come back out. Gets out there, oh my god. It was that I know. I had left at the door to our bedroom open. Okay, Jessica. I see, I go into the bath. I go into back into that and other kids are sleeping. And I see on the far side of the bed, okay, by the windows. I see, not its body just its head poking out from the bed from behind the bed. And I’m like, oh fuck, and I got ey.

 

Jessica St. Clair  31:33

Like, you became like a British lorry driver?

 

June Diane Raphael  31:36

Oh, boy, what are you doing?

 

Jessica St. Clair  31:39

You can’t chase a cat?

 

June Diane Raphael  31:42

You can’t, well, turns out you can’t. And also, it’s and then as I’m saying, boy, to this cat. It slowly retreats behind the bed. I can’t see it now. And Gus is like half naked, splayed out on the bed. And I’m like, what do I do? What do I do? And so I made such a difficult decision to sacrifice my children. I left the door open to that room in the hopes I almost shut the door closed. But I was like, I have to give this cat a chance to get out of the room. And then I went into man’s office and I slept on a tiny couch. Okay, tiny leather couch. Office was the only other place that had a door like where I could close myself in a way.

 

Jessica St. Clair  32:30

So you sacrifice Gus thinking, well, maybe he’ll make it through breathing and maybe not. But I have to get out of here and you left them with that cat?

 

June Diane Raphael  32:40

I did, I left them with that.

 

Jessica St. Clair  32:42

That’s funny.

 

June Diane Raphael  32:43

That I didn’t know I don’t know how to tame a cat.

 

Jessica St. Clair  32:47

No, if you’re if you don’t speak Catlin, as you don’t know.

 

June Diane Raphael  32:50

And when I tell you, Jess, and people say this about cats, but boy was a true. When I saw it peeking that bed. The energy was like, I got you bitch, I got you. Okay, and then it moved away. It was like it was game over for me and.

 

Jessica St. Clair  33:13

It in owns you. They are not afraid they don’t, they’re not afraid of anything. And you know that there is and this is? Again, why is this an animal podcast but cats are a huge problem in Los Angeles because they have like 1 million kittens a year. So there will always be more cats than people always there are so many cats. You’re living amongst, like not more Yang’s people have wild cats in Los Angeles, they’ve taken over it’s kind of a thing. They don’t know what to do. And you know why there’s more black and tabby cats. Again, I’ve spent so much time at this cat cafe where you just lay around.

 

June Diane Raphael  33:54

No, but Jess, let me ask you something seriously, I want to know why there’s more black in, and I didn’t know that.

 

Jessica St. Clair  33:59

They camouflage, they’re the ones who survived because in the in the night. Black and Tabby is camouflage. So that’s why there’s more of them than the other cars. They’re creatures of the night. That’s the truth.

 

June Diane Raphael  34:14

And I didn’t know that, and Nancy said that in the morning, she’s like, yeah, they’re well they’re nocturnal. Like goddamn I didn’t know cats are nocturnal. Why would you ever domesticate a pet that’s nocturnal.

 

Jessica St. Clair  34:24

Ask the Egyptians. I mean, this is a tale as old as time they’ve been around, you know, they’ve they are perfectly evolved. They have not evolved at all since the Egyptian times. That’s the cat that the Egyptians had we have now. Okay, I don’t want to know this.

 

June Diane Raphael  34:41

Like, are you suggesting that we’ve evolved around cats like they’ve stayed the same and we changes?

 

Jessica St. Clair  34:50

Yes, they’re the perfect machine. And when I tell you my dad is so obsessed with his cat, Thomas R Two, T two so that, you know, my family was having a particularly difficult Christmas as you know. And I came downstairs and my dad was in the basement, which is his office covered of course and posters of playing house that I don’t even know where he got them from. And he was playing Pink Floyd to his cat Tasar he said he really enjoys this album. Okay, so like, it’s takes, he’s at he’s 18 and I just looked at him over Christmas and I said, you motherfucker, you got to stay alive for at least another year.

 

June Diane Raphael  35:43

18? Cats live that long?

 

Jessica St. Clair  35:49

It can live to like 22 and we hope he does I go I don’t care if I have to like Weekend at Bernie’s you were like what, but like this cat whilst we are in the underworld as a collective St. Clair tribe, this cat must stay alive. And he’s given us some scares, and so I just honestly he goes down the rest of the ship goes to.

 

June Diane Raphael  39:35

It’s so fascinating to me that now I’m just like understanding your that you like cats and actually kind of are a cat.

 

Jessica St. Clair  40:32

I do, I’m not nocturnal. Certainly you’re right. I’m not a dog.

 

June Diane Raphael  40:39

No, I’m.

 

Jessica St. Clair  40:39

Just like I just a gator. Yeah, you are you’re I don’t know.

 

June Diane Raphael  40:46

God.

 

Jessica St. Clair  40:47

But that’s the funny thing about cats is like, and that’s why you’re such a cat. It’s because they’re so there’s so slippery.

 

June Diane Raphael  40:58

Dan and I moved to LA. We lived in an a not so savory part of of Santa Monica actually. And we were true, we were so depressed that we tried to go for a walk. It was at night probably like 9:30, we didn’t have kids yet. And all of a sudden a black furry one of those like gigantic, lots of fur, jumped out of a hedge. And where and again, this is where you know what you’re dealing with Dan screamed, run for your life and took off. And I was very far behind him. He didn’t know what it was. But it was very much a save yourself scenario. And I was like that’s like that, that that movie that Will Ferrell and Julia Louis Dreyfus remade where the avalanche came. I was like you fucking took off. You didn’t know what that thing was.

 

Jessica St. Clair  41:47

Well, I understand those instincts. He’s allergic he hates them.

 

June Diane Raphael  41:52

That he missed me that seem as if he took off I’ve never seen so fast. I left my child who’s also allergic in the middle of the night. We didn’t even have the wherewithal to say like, hey, Gus, come sleep over here. Like I was just like, I’m added here, I’m out of here.

 

Jessica St. Clair  42:10

People also don’t get it like I’m not trying to be like, difficult. I simply can’t breathe in this home and my parents were like, take a Benadryl like, they don’t care. They’re like they had comes first.

 

June Diane Raphael  42:23

A little bit like people don’t really know you’ve just how alerting.

 

Jessica St. Clair  42:27

It’s like an anti histamine response. It’s not your body is in distress.

 

June Diane Raphael  42:33

Oh, I have no control over it. When I was in when I was in middle school, I went over to my friend a marina, what’s his house she had cats. And I didn’t this is when I found out I was alert. I pet the cat and then I rubbed my eye.

 

Jessica St. Clair  42:45

Couldn’t see it.

 

June Diane Raphael  42:46

And I literally had to go to the ER because my eye blew up, so frightening. So I’m just I can’t be around them for extended periods of time without a lot of medication. But, but Jess, you know.

 

Jessica St. Clair  43:02

I bet my nan was just like, I bet your best friend was like, oh, yeah, they’re nocturnal, like, oh, no big deal. Like you had to sleep on a couch like yeah, that’s okay. They own the place.

 

June Diane Raphael  43:11

No, listen, she felt really she was absolutely mortified that I slept on the couch and she married into cats. Okay, I wouldn’t, she married into cats, so what can you do about that? Nothing, but I just, I guess what I want to ask you though, is when you’re hanging around your family cats. are you connecting with them?

 

Jessica St. Clair  43:32

Yes, they were all I had they were close the closest I could get to a dog so like our our cats. And again our cats are like, you know get get Pink Floyd played to them so they’re much more like dogs in that way that they connect to you. But we’ve had to like warm up to Thomas R Two like for years and years before he like accepted us. You know, it wasn’t until I moved into the basement of my parents house last summer quite randomly that he fully embraced us as part of the tribe. So I don’t know what to tell you. I mean, I’ll get I’ll take an animal however, I can get my hands on them but interesting, you don’t have cats, is that just because of damn. Because the day he couldn’t breathe? Believe me, I’ve tried to bring them in the house? Of course I have, and he’s like, do you care more about them than me? Like that’s why I can’t breathe. Please somebody take me seriously.

 

June Diane Raphael  44:23

Believe me, believe men, and believe women.

 

Jessica St. Clair  44:29

Believe me.

 

June Diane Raphael  44:31

Jess, did I ever tell the story about my friend who’s whose mother works for the Houston Zoo and they always had a boa constrictor. So many crazy amount of the ferret that I adopted, I told you about that in college.

 

Jessica St. Clair  44:42

Yes.

 

June Diane Raphael  44:43

Yeah, but when I was at and then we were unfit mothers and she had to take the ferret but I was in her bathroom or parents bathroom when I was visiting Houston. And I was on the toilet and I heard [..]  And I was like, the fuck something’s breathing in here. And I looked down and it was Mr. T the tortoise. He was like 95 years old, and he was staring up at me going […] Like, that big fucking just is everywhere in the house, you never know.

 

Jessica St. Clair  45:30

Wow.

 

June Diane Raphael  45:32

So the animals are. I mean, honestly, if I could be around them every minute of the day, it’s all I want.

 

Jessica St. Clair  45:40

I know and I love.

 

June Diane Raphael  45:42

You’re so beautifully connected to them. I mean, it’s very interesting, because like, I will tell you, I mean this very deeply, you know, I’ve now been fostering […] foster fail adopting to pretty, like decently sized pitbulls. And nothing is like made me nervous. And the way that I’ve been absolutely terrified of cats and their energy, you know, on our old house, Jess, we had like, remember, there was sort of that, like, outside part when you walked in there was like, that little atrium area. I walked in one day and there was a cat there. And I was like, oh, fucking hell no. And I left the door open and I ran to into the house from the back. And then I came to the front, the little french doors, and I looked out and that cat is sitting at the door waiting. And I’m like, and it didn’t leave for such a long time. And I was taking pictures sending it to Paul. I’m like, get it out, get it out. Someone’s gone texting the neighbors who lost a cat there’s a cat here. No color, and finally and but in that moment, I genuinely was like, we must move like there’s no if this cat, it’s home.

 

Jessica St. Clair  47:06

Comfortable picking up and leaving. It’s very disturbing to me.

 

June Diane Raphael  47:09

I was so ready to be like, this is it, we’re out of here […] Eventually, our neighbor like directed me to a woman whose cat it was but it was so frightening to see that level of like, I fucking own you bitch.

 

Jessica St. Clair  47:26

Yes it does they do own again, they also don’t need to come inside. And you remember the woman who put the ice caps on me when I was going through treatment Gail, she had 51 cats she lived with and Lenin was gotten so involved in Gail’s cat rescue, she trapped on, she trapped the wild ones and we would you know from the wild because that’s why it’s such a problem, they’re having so many kittens in the wild. But she had names for all of them. And so one time I would go to sleep they would give me so many drugs that I would fall asleep. And I literally woke up to Lenin writing all of their names on a on an envelope and she was like number 49 Katy Perry,  number 50 Mr. Mustapha Lee’s number 52, and I was like, what are you doing? She’s like, I just get involved. I get involved in all of their dramas who’s got mange who’s you know? But what it loves I mean but this woman was an angel on earth angel on earth.

 

June Diane Raphael  47:30

To be clear wish the best for cats.

 

Jessica St. Clair  48:31

Yeah, I’m again I’m ruled by them so it’s like I’m also I want people I know people are gonna be upset about it, but it’s also like cat energy. I’m just like they’re dictators you know, this is an oppressive regime but I’m I don’t I don’t wish harm upon them I just I’m you know, struggling with my own sovereignty. This podcast is so stupid.

 

June Diane Raphael  49:04

Why are they what else? What else?

 

Jessica St. Clair  49:10

What else do we have, you know? Oh, what else got so much work to do between now and the end of March.

 

June Diane Raphael  49:19

Kind of feel that way. I’m just racing towards summer.

 

Jessica St. Clair  49:23

Yes, got so much work to do. And I’m trying to chip away at it and not get overwhelmed by it. Very hard chop wood carry water. Dan is a chop wood carry water. He doesn’t get overwhelmed by deadlines or whatever. I think I have such all or nothing thinking, I’m like, there’s a deadline. It’s like college lets everybody live in the house. And we’ll order in until it’s done until three weeks from now. So I’m really trying to do something different but boy, oh boy.

 

June Diane Raphael  49:58

You know it the time change has not helped us. I’ve been single parenting for the last few days, and I’m the time change. I know it’s this looks so simple right sour but it’s like it really seems to have gotten us pretty good over here.

 

Jessica St. Clair  50:16

Oh, for sure, you know also for me because the sunshine is such a it’s beckoning me at 5:45 Yesterday, I was like, fuck it, let’s head down, bring the dogs down. He’s like Dan like it’s dinner time. I’m like, is it though? It’s not, and so everyone’s up till nine. You know, it’s like it’s a disaster over here in that way and so.

 

June Diane Raphael  50:37

But I love that.

 

Jessica St. Clair  50:38

I do, it summer already. For me, I’m like, Oh, enough is enough with the number.

 

June Diane Raphael  50:43

Let’s wrap it up.

 

June Diane Raphael  50:45

Let’s wrap it up. It’s time for summer, and then let’s head into the holidays because this over this.

 

June Diane Raphael  50:52

I will say as much as the time change is hard. There’s something about it being light. At 6, 6:37 one close to seven. That is so wonderful.

 

Jessica St. Clair  51:08

Tumbler time you get free service over at 5:30 in the dark.

 

June Diane Raphael  51:12

No, you can’t. So I know people want to lose the tie.

 

Jessica St. Clair  51:18

No, I don’t I need it. I need this bump, I honestly I needed to signal the time of renewal I do I need it. I need it as a little bump. For me, this is for me, I take this time change very personally. And I feel like it’s for me.

 

June Diane Raphael  51:36

You know what has been really centering me and I don’t think we can do it this week. But we will be back is our academy happy hours now for those of you don’t know, we’ve been hosting these happy hours on Fridays for our students at the Academy. And we do it on Instagram Live and it’s really fun. And it’s just been God is it like really launched me into the weekend. And I’ve just really been enjoying it, Jess.

 

Jessica St. Clair  52:03

Me too, it’s a ritual too, it’s like Friday, now we do it at 3pm. Now part of it is that we get to knock off now we we did have quite a few drinks, and then we went back to work at four which was.

 

June Diane Raphael  52:15

That was a mistake. I’m going to try to handle my schedule, so that doesn’t happen.

 

Jessica St. Clair  52:19

But it’s so fun to just have a drink and go oh, it’s the weekend like what is the weekend hold for us, you know, because I think also with kids and all of their activities. It can be a bit of a grind, you know?  But the weekends are time for you know, frivolous activity, you know?

 

June Diane Raphael  52:40

I just tell you, so I can I know I’m going back to animals, but I did go in San Diego where I went this weekend. We went to a dog beach.

 

Jessica St. Clair  52:52

Okay, yeah, San Diego. Nobody’s trying too hard down there. Do you know what I mean?

 

June Diane Raphael  52:59

It’s so true.

 

Jessica St. Clair  53:00

They are living is easy down there. It’s easy down there, yes.

 

June Diane Raphael  53:07

Yes, now, you know, Paul obviously did a whole show that I did with him called NTSF SD SUV, which stood for National Strike For San Diego Sportster Utility Vehicle but there were a lot of San Diego jokes. And they were just just about that pretty much which was like, why is San Diego you know.

 

Jessica St. Clair  53:29

Yeah, and not a titan of industry. You know, and that’s what I love about it, like when.

 

June Diane Raphael  53:36

I kept on asking what’s the main industry here? And I think I got like a lot of remote workers. I was like, okay.

 

Jessica St. Clair  53:43

I don’t know what is up down there. But I like the vibe, I learned.

 

June Diane Raphael  53:48

A lot of money and like La Jolla and like those, but I went to this dog beach and apparently people move there for this dog beach so.

 

Jessica St. Clair  53:58

Yes, I can imagine it.

 

June Diane Raphael  54:01

Oh, Jess.

 

Jessica St. Clair  54:02

There anything better than dogs, Galavan.

 

June Diane Raphael  54:06

And it’s so big that they were really just they’re all off leash and they’re all living, they’re living, and to honestly polar bears that arrived to white polar bears, and to see them running about with like little yips and yaps and then different all these breeds together.

 

Jessica St. Clair  54:31

I was if you are depressed, now it’s so the two times I’ve had like, you know, been fired. I’ve been like, I’ve woken up and said, take me to the dog beach and Dan has dragged my lifeless body to Seal Beach where there is one it’s an hour away, you have to drive that long.

 

June Diane Raphael  54:50

I know, should I go though it sounds it’s a long drive.

 

Jessica St. Clair  54:53

It is fun, but I gotta tell you if you really low and you know what you’ve already got spray tan, you’ve tried the you’ve tried the regular stuff. Seal Beach is another place where people aren’t trying that hard. They’re covered in ink. Everybody is tattooed within the inch of their lives. They all look like Jesse James. So you don’t have to feel like you come as you are it Seal Beach is what I’ll say. And but if you are down and maybe we’ll do a little bit of a field trip there because it’ll show me the person who cannot be happy watching dogs go nuts on a beach.

 

June Diane Raphael  55:30

There ain’t one.

 

Jessica St. Clair  55:32

Yeah, and I didn’t know these things even existed. I didn’t know there were dog beaches. So bond [..] type of feeling and everyone also there is like loving each other’s dogs. It’s okay that your dog comes out over and like jumps on someone’s picnic blanket. Like it’s cute, it’s fun, and it’s fun and it’s their time. And we are so happy to honestly have been invited like that was the feeling like I’m just happy that they’re okay with me here.

 

June Diane Raphael  56:01

Because the fun that they’re having is outrageous, it’s just they’re running through the water. There, it was so much fun and then yeah, occasionally it’s like oh, that’s his ball. Okay, yeah, here let me get that ball back to you drop that unit Sure but boy oh boy. My one of my favorite things in the world, I’m so sorry this is such an animal podcast.

 

Jessica St. Clair  56:30

It is what it is.

 

June Diane Raphael  56:32

One of my favorite thing is a must love dogs, must love dogs are one of my favorite things. You see a dog because it’s like sometimes Bingos like picking up socks and stuff off the floor.

 

June Diane Raphael  56:44

And what the fuck does he know the difference between a sock and and a toy? Like he doesn’t. But to see him when where he gets a sock or something, and then we’re like, drop it, drop it, to see the way he then prances around with it is joyful. God it makes me.

 

Jessica St. Clair  56:44

Yeah.

 

Jessica St. Clair  57:02

It’s joyful, one time […] one time in New Hampshire where I Bibi and I had overstayed our welcome at my parents house, and of course, Cookie was a puppy and was terrorizing Thomas R. Two.

 

June Diane Raphael  57:18

Yeah, how that go?

 

Jessica St. Clair  57:19

It didn’t go well. Not well at all. It almost broke my family apart, and that’s no joke. It did create a rift that we’re still healing from, I’m serious. It was not good. It was mistakes were made members.

 

June Diane Raphael  57:32

I do remember getting a text that like Cookie was not being welcomed in the way that you had hoped.

 

Jessica St. Clair  57:40

I thought I thought bringing a puppy that’s not house trained to your parents, your elderly parents home would be a welcome surprise. It wasn’t. But one time Cookie peeled a dehydrated smash Toad carcass off the blacktop of the driveway. She peeled it off and ran into the house. And then all I can tell you is I chased her because I was like, oh my God, you know, my mother’s Martha Stewart’s house. And I chased her and I could hear the Benny Hill Music […] And as because he was racing around the house because he thought his game, pieces of dehydrated Toad are flinging off into the home. It was a nightmare. It was a nightmare.

 

June Diane Raphael  58:37

Oh my god, that’s so funny.

 

Jessica St. Clair  58:39

But also the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. But it was like If my mother comes in and sees this, these, this Toad carcass, you know, flinging into the air, we’re going to be in a lot of trouble.

 

June Diane Raphael  58:51

Well, I at one point when I was working at this restaurant waitressing in in my 20s. The bartender very nice guy was going away, he was musician and he was like, oh, I’m going away for a couple weeks, like do you have any desire to stay at my apartment? Now I was in I think it was still at my parents house. And he had an apartment in Brooklyn, like right in Bloomsburg, right off the train. I was like, yeah, of course. He was such a lovely guy so he, I get there. And he’s like, oh, yeah, I have a cat. And I’m like, and he’s like, but but she’s mostly an outdoor cat. And I was like, okay, I ran out got my Benadryl because I’ve already committed he’s now gone to tour. So you’re gonna do but I’ll never forget I had a suitcase that I was living out of. And one day I came home and he always told me like, leave the window open so caca glass and come back in. And one day I come back and I go into my suitcase, like change into my night clothes. And there’s a fucking bird in there […]

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:00:01

They do hate you. That’s like what the mafia does.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:00:05

Like, I was told, because I was like, I gotta get out of here. Like, I can’t ever go into the suitcase again, like, I was so fucking upset.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:00:13

They bring it as a prize to you.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:00:14

That’s what I heard. I told everybody I was like, this cat wants to kill me. And they’re like, no, actually, that was a sign of love.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:00:23

Like that, but that’s where you’re okay. And then I know, we’ve talked for an hour about dogs and cats. With that’s where you’re, I understand the disconnect, because you’re like this, and I don’t springing this dead carcass as a present. And that’s not something you want. That’s like when you have two different love languages. And it’s just hard to make it work.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:00:49

It’s so true, because I did it. You’re exactly right, that it was like a mafia hit. I was like I’ve been marked, you know. Like, they’re all going to come from me. And I couldn’t go back into my suitcase. Like it was so terrible. I just zip it up and throw everything out.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:01:07

I hate to bring them up, but I tell you what Jason Mantzoukas did to me once.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:01:11

No.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:01:12

We were house sitting, you know, I can’t believe in our 20s we like survived this type of Vagabond existence. But really, I don’t even know whose house was it. But we had to come out to LA with me money. And so the two of us were house sitting for some house God I don’t even know where it was, was this beautiful modern house. And on the way out, I had, we were in JetBlue eating our snacks and I started to watch a lifetime show was a reenactment of a crime. Who was very gruesome where was the women would be abducted from a fast food drive thru window right up my alley, okay. And then they would get you know, taped up and then the in the reenactment that killer would then whisper, man, I take your order into there. So I started to watch it, and Jason said, like, they took some creative liberties without reenact probably, but I’ll never forget, like, it’s still burning. And so I was starting to watch it. And Jason said, just so you know, I don’t think you can handle something like this. And I said, please don’t tell me what to do. I’m not in your conservative ship like, please stop mansplaining go watch your own thing. I’m gonna watch this. I can handle this and don’t tell me what to do. And so what he did was the night we got there to LA again, foreign land, trying to launch a career very nervous, far from home. He waited until I fell asleep. He kept himself up.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:02:50

Oh, wait a second.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:02:51

He crept in to the room and whispered may I take your order? In my face? Sick?

 

June Diane Raphael  1:03:05

How fucking sick is sick stuff? Sick and fucked up.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:03:11

Yeah, that’s the kind of Terror i was living with.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:03:14

I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry. Yeah, it’s like I was dealing with like dead cats in my suitcases but I was alone like to have to be in that somebody was like […] Yeah, that’s a whole other that’s a whole other people […]

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:03:29

Like does Zouk’s Cubes and Zouk’s Cubes and this and that. And like they don’t know what the real thing to travel with him, okay?

 

June Diane Raphael  1:03:40

Yeah, anyway, guys. Last thing, I promise and then we’re gonna wrap it up. One thing that I really love, so you know, Justin down the block, my friend he, his his dog has been like playing wonderfully with our dogs, with Van Gogh and so he texted I said, hey, does Sisi want to play date? You know, and does he want to have a playdate with Bingo? And he wrote back I don’t know why when we we laughed so hard because not the first time he’s written this back. When I’ve asked and he’ll he’ll write back she would love to. Just like she would love to like Jess, and I know we shouldn’t anthropomorphize and all that stuff, it just really makes me laugh.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:04:28

I love it.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:04:28

I would love too. I just love it so much.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:04:32

It’s fun, this is fun.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:04:36

I don’t know God. Where the fuck is this podcast going? Just one more exchange on text that made me laugh so hard, Jack McBrayer, if you you know, the comedian Jack McBrayer from 30 Rock and he remembers everybody’s birthdays and texts you on your birthday, which is the sweetest thing ever. You will not have seen him in years and he’ll text you but he texted me randomly and said hey sweetie, I was just thinking about you how you do and I I think the last time I saw you was a year ago and I said, yes, I go and surprisingly, I look younger now. And I said, do you think I have Benjamin Button syndrome? And he wrote no, you’ve got Benjamin butthole syndrome.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:05:28

Really?

 

June Diane Raphael  1:05:29

Oh, thrilled me. And that was it. I will hear from him again for another year.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:05:36

That’ll tide you over though.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:05:38

You’ve Benjamim buttholes.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:05:40

Too mean, I love it.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:05:42

We’ll Jess, you know, yet again, I came in today, and I felt sad. And I was like, I don’t really know what I got to offer. I’m not doing this podcast the right time. It’s too early. And I’m walking out feeling lighter. And how to thank you.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:05:58

Me too, me too. And thank you for indulging us some of these podcasts, some of these episodes are going to be for Mommy, you know, they’re not going to be for anyone else. And that’s, you know.

Jessica St. Clair  1:06:12

Yeah, stay with us.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:06:15

This is exactly what you should expect, I don’t know.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:06:20

Yes, and please join the Academy if you’d like we’re going to I actually did think I’d love to do homework assignment about people’s pets I’d love or at least a happy hour where people who lose their pets. A yappy hour.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:06:33

Yes.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:06:38

I stole that from the gym club. We do yappy hours there, but like yes, yes, we do the Yappy Hour.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:06:45

Come join us, we’re doing some really weird things.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:06:48

Really weird assignment.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:06:49

Who knows? I actually wanted to talk to you about this, Jess but I would love to do start doing a you know, our episodes come out on Wednesday, start doing a recap show alive.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:07:03

Great.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:07:04

Where we can just kind of, yeah, we can just kind of talk about like, I mean, I don’t know that there’s any more to say.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:07:12

Watch What Happens Live, watch What Happens Live where […] we’re also going, you know, listen, I love the DMs I get from everybody about their responses because you know, they really do feel that that this is a two way podcast. It they’ve got suggestions for us if we’re struggling with something pill boxes, I have so many so many I still get you know, for you about how to remember your Wellbutrin, you know, they’re thinking about us.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:07:39

Yeah, so appreciate that.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:07:41

We need it that’s like we need it. And I just wanted to wait.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:07:45

Because this is the type of stuff we need to address in the after show but I just want to say that I did get myself together in terms of my poll taking.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:07:53

I had something that was just what a lot of people were suggesting, which was like morning afternoon I had that I just couldn’t find it for very long. So I did find it and on the right dose of well, you tried that pin […] bounce yeah. That’s the chicken or the egg.

 

June Diane Raphael  1:08:12

Yeah, exactly, you know. While Jess, I’ve never stopped thinking about the fact that cats haven’t evolved in yet we’ve evolved around them I’ll never stop thinking about that as long as I live I’ll never stop questioning their you know, dictatorship oppressive regime that we all.

 

Jessica St. Clair  1:08:31

You know why they meow? Do you want to know why they meow? I’m gonna leave you with this chilling fact. They don’t meow to each other. It is not a thing that cats do to anyone else than humans. And that is because they have learned to mimic a baby’s cry. We’ll be back next week.

Kulap Vilaysack  01:39

Well, because he told us about how he loves a sweet treat at night.

 

Lamar Woods  01:42

That’s true, yeah, he’s a he has a sweet.

 

SuChin Pak  01:44

I’ve never known anybody to eat more birthday cake slices. I still think about.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  01:52

Slices of cake, and he picks one up every week.

 

Lamar Woods  01:56

But I thank you for saying I have pretty eyes though, I appreciate that. That is my favorite attribute. I was with my therapist last week and I did this really cool thing where this cool thing. But like sometimes I just be making shit up, like this is what I would do if I was a therapist. I was like let’s write down all the things that I get insecure about when when a girl rejects me. And I wonder like because I’m not insecure about them all the time, only when you get rejected they all come out right? So we just wrapped I just we just made it list and we’re gonna go every week we’re going to talk about each one and try to figure out how to like not like fall slave to those insecurities.

 

SuChin Pak  02:36

Wow, New York Times, best seller number one straight to the top, Self Help.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  02:44

Wait, you’re right, Su.

 

SuChin Pak  02:46

Straight to the top. Let me tell you how to be a therapist. We’re just workshopping titles, we’re just workshopping.

 

Lamar Woods  02:54

Yeah, what do you think?

 

SuChin Pak  02:56

It’s good, it’s good.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  02:57

Su, as absolutely right. I want you to be journaling about this, taking notes about this because this could be a book.

 

Lamar Woods  03:04

Really, yeah.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  03:04

Like I’m being serious, like, just do it for the sake of doing it. Yes, I’m getting serious.

 

Lamar Woods  03:09

Because when I told my therapist I was she was like, oh, that’s a good idea.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  03:13

And she’s writing it, right now.

 

Lamar Woods  03:18

She did tell me just like I’m working, I’m trying to figure out I want to write a book but I don’t want to write about yeah. Oh, no, right pretty eyes is obviously not on that list so being short was on that list. I never felt like a short guy. I don’t seem short. Well, I guess I’m on that on a zooms, I don’t know, anyway, it was was talking about shopping. So I told you, I’d talk to you today so I’m just gonna start blabbing around likes to start talking because I’m like, oh, this human beings but yeah, so we’re gonna go through each one, that’s a good idea. I’m not going to talk about it no more. That’s my book. That’s what I’m gonna do. Because they only you only feel, I mean, some of them you feel them a lot but like when you get rejected, they take over and become powerful. So we got to figure out how to how to like break them down each one and where they come from to like, okay, maybe height comes from playing sports in school, high school, and being the smallest kid on the team. And that’s a source of insecurity for me, because I never was never successful in that, or something. Oh, yeah, I’m writing a book, right so let’s go.

 

SuChin Pak  04:16

Look at this.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  04:17

Okay, well, this feels like the perfect transition to talk about your album, Highly Sensitive Person. But wait, let’s we should pause real quick, like why am I even talking right now? I mean, this is our first Add To Cart music cue interview. We’re gonna listen to some of your songs. We’re going to ask you questions. But again, why am I talking when we have a veteran MTV News person in our midst?

 

SuChin Pak  04:43

I was so nervous to meet you today.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  05:03

Britney Spears.

 

Lamar Woods  05:04

I’m a big fan. I’m a big fan.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  05:07

Probably Three Doors Down, Lamar, and now Lamar Woods, and now Lamar woods.

 

Lamar Woods  05:13

Now I want to kind of give you a different song oh, I got some other songs. I didn’t know you’re gonna play it real time I got to talk about it.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  05:23

That’s how interviews work. You’re supposed to play a song, I bought my head okay. Like, I know, I have any rhythm. We’re kind of quiet, we’re vibing we’re feeling it.

 

SuChin Pak  05:39

The truck cuts. And then it goes to the first question. And my first question could be something, you know, just like an icebreaker. You know, right. I was thinking your album is titled Highly Sensitive Person, now, sometimes, a title says it all. So is it true? Are you an HSP? We sort of discussed this up at the top. So now I kind of have more of an answer before I met you but let’s talk about that.

 

Lamar Woods  06:07

I mean, you could probably tell immediately, but yeah, I at first, I really did just think it was a cool album title, because I liked I liked the word highly. And I like when people put highly in front of things, like highly favored or like, highly empowered. So I was like, oh, just gonna be dumb, highly sensitive, and I figured out what sensitive. But then I was like doing the album. And I was like, it’d be something I have to talk about on podcasts, like Add To Cart. And I was like, maybe I should actually take the test and see if this is a real thing for me. And this is this is last year, and I took the test and the test was like, if you answered more than 14 of these questions yes, then you’re highly sensitive. And I answered 24 yes.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  06:50

24 to 24.

 

Lamar Woods  06:52

Yeah, I was like I like aced it. And then okay, I just real quick, I just said I know this song I want to replace one of the songs is we’re talking about how.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  07:01

No, you’re not allowed. You’re not allowed to what […] you think about? Well, I don’t know, you think you think about the that you’re thinking? And we’ll end the episode with that song.

 

Lamar Woods  07:13

Okay, okay. I just gave you like, the songs I gave you were more like, what I would call the singles, you know, but I was like, if we’re getting deep, I was like, oh, let’s get into these album cuts, okay, anyway.

 

SuChin Pak  07:23

You let the aunties tell you what you should you’re okay […] With your pretty eyes, tell me where to let me tell you where to sit.

 

Lamar Woods  07:33

But I took that test and I started crying because some of the questions were so specific, like, like stuff that I was never, you know, obviously, I always thought it was a sensitive person. But like, there’s things that I’m like, oh, yeah, I don’t like watching violence on movies and movies that I was like, yeah, I thought that was just me, but it’s like a part of it, and I was like, crying because I was like, oh, this is me. And it made me it made me rethink everything. Like I had to read this. And then and then I really once I did that, I went back and did recorded another 10 songs. And just like, really, really explored the highly sensitive aspect in the album too. So except for the songs that you guys get.

 

SuChin Pak  08:23

I love it, the title chose you. You know, it’s like the sword. You know what I mean?

 

Lamar Woods  08:29

Yeah, it changed my life, yeah.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  08:32

You’re known as a comedian. But this album, this isn’t a comedic album. This is an earnest hip hop record.

 

Lamar Woods  08:40

Oh, yeah, this is this is real rap right here. This is hip hop for sure. Like I was a rapper for a long time in my 20s and then I just got into comedy and never got back to it and then we went on strike and I was like, I was like, I really want to have a rap album before I die you know just to exist you know? And so it’s very sincere but there is some funny like elements to it is some skits on it and there’s like, got like Mike Mitchell from the Doughboys is in one of his kids. So it’s and Tony Baker a stand up comedian. So there’s an element of my comedy world in the album which I don’t want to hide from but it’s that that was not fun, it’s not like we’re now yanking pitches.

 

SuChin Pak  09:20

Well, let’s listen to some songs. Are you both ready?

 

Lamar Woods  09:23

Alright, do it like MTV? Like like got it you do the MTV thing like they like hey, what’s up and we we got this spring is spring break.

 

09:39

New mix. I’m […] leave the girl alone. Yeah, my […] pistol in the drawers and the Buddha on the shelf. A little Prozac just for my mental health. Marty McFly Nagel back from the future, hands holding hands girl don’t let me lose you. This is my life and I ain’t looking back. Batty on the best, but yet as looking fat. I’m on my second wind yet is zero cooking crack. Music is my best friend, I make a lot of rap, let’s go. Therapy, smoke […] we went up Phil panic, and I gotta breathe. Trying to satisfy nigga needs. Yeah, gotta satisfy nigga needs.

 

SuChin Pak  10:17

Wan’t sensitive. You talked about therapy, okay literally in.

 

Lamar Woods  10:26

this, But I also talked about stealing someone’s girl.

 

SuChin Pak  10:29

We contain multitude.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  10:33

Sensitive people can do that, in fact I would argue that’s a secret superpower.

 

SuChin Pak  10:39

To a lot of sensitive guys.

 

Lamar Woods  10:42

That’s very true. That’s all works. Okay yeah, I’ve done a front porch and those songs are great actually, it sounded really good in my headphones, so I’m glad that was one of the songs. I was like this should tell you.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  11:00

Okay, let’s listen next to one that got away.

 

11:04

If I was in Atlanta, I’ll probably be married by now. If I was in Atlanta, then I’ll probably be married by now. She the one that got away. I don’t know what else to say, say, she the one that got away. I don’t know what else to say mama saw them women on my shed baby fine baby fit and Yukon and you reg tight like Lilo and some Stitch. This house is big. I can fuck you in a […] I’m from LA. but um, but that took the train to Georgia. I met this girl named.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  11:40

Oh my god, if reading your auntie.

 

Lamar Woods  11:44

I was like, I don’t want to play this way, that’s what I didn’t want to play. Like, it’s hot there’s a family moment. And that’s like literally the one song that’s like that vulgar. Like, pretty much most of the songs are very sensitive. But hey, look, I’m from Atlanta, I had to do it, yeah. There’s a running theme in the album about an inability to commit, you know, so I think even though that song is like, was kind of like, oh, I think this would be fun to have like an, like a club banger, or whatever. The song is kind of about me like being single for a very long time. And like, I’d really feel like I blame la for that, and I think I think if I’d never left LA, I think I’d be married and by now, literally, was Atlanta, I’ll be married but if you know.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  12:31

If you never left Atlanta, you would be married by now.

 

Lamar Woods  12:33

That’s what I’d say yeah. I feel like I’m having a hard time dating in the city but I think Atlanta is like, not that there’s something special about Atlanta. I think it’s more than LA is hard to date here. So that’s that so even in that song, there’s still an element of like an emotional thing I’m struggling with.

 

SuChin Pak  12:50

I think LA is the hardest city in the world to date. I like can’t think of another city that I’ve either been to or theoretically know about. That has the confluence of how sprawling it is to you know that we’re all in our cars all the time to that it’s a one in town. It’s lonely, I mean, there’s so many aspects to LA that I just don’t understand how people date in LA.

 

Lamar Woods  13:22

Yeah, I really feel like the times when I had the most success in LA it was usually somebody who was from here who like grew up here. I think there’s something about people being not having roots in a city where I’m like, oh, you were dating each other you have your family’s not here, not here. My family’s not here. I think it’s hard to like build a relationship sometimes where you’re like we are each other’s only really foundation and it’s sometimes it feels like it feels like people just kind of bail on it and also just too many people I think a lot of it is just like a numbers thing where like I think everyone knows that if they it doesn’t work out there’s there’s enough people here today someone else and and then it ends up people end up like just moving on quicker. But so that’s what that song is about. If I was in Atlanta be married by now.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  15:52

Lamar, let’s transition into your cart. But first we want to know what type of shopper are you? What’s your style?

 

Lamar Woods  18:51

I shop online a lot and I usually do the best sight ASOS and I’m like buying clothes on there but recently I was working on a pilot like as my luxury fashion I realized I didn’t know what I was talking about. I had to get into it and I started going to the mall like old school like the Beverly Center. I want to go in those stores where it’s like security like you have to like go wait in line and go in and I got addicted to it so that’s like to your auntie so now I, that’s how I shop now like only in luxury stuff.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  19:29

I did not that left turn. I’m sorry. You went from shopping online at ASOS to security guards?

 

Lamar Woods  19:39

Well because now I like it. […] yeah, I when I shop now I don’t go shopping a lot like and I I guess I’m really talking about clothing right now. But if we’re talking about other stuff, if it’s like outside of clothing, it’s just usually like in my neighborhood like local shopping or whatever. But as far as like clothing, which is my favorite thing to shop for or I am like fully going back to like old school Rick and Morty like in the store trying shit on because I usually don’t buy a lot of things at once I like like when I had I had a show last week. I bought the outfit like the day of and I went so I went to like I think it was Prada, when they’re saying I’m over here flex shouldn’t be flexing.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  20:23

Shows about baby.

 

SuChin Pak  20:24

You’re not going to be single at the end of this episode, let me tell you.

 

Lamar Woods  20:32

I’m not gonna buy prada, like I can’t do I so.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  20:36

That’s good that you say that, Su, it’s good that he makes that disclaimer.

 

Lamar Woods  20:41

It’s only for me.

 

SuChin Pak  20:45

No, there’s a lot of wonderful ladies who who really appreciate a man who knows what’s going on, know it’s about qualities.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  20:56

And appreciation for the finest thing.

 

SuChin Pak  20:58

Yeah, that can bleed into other areas of that relationship. All I’m saying.

 

Lamar Woods  21:05

TThat’s very true. What I like about it is like I’m just really big on cuz I used to be a manager at a wax museum isn’t that related at all but customer service is like use to me. So I like to experience. Timeout.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  21:27

Wax museum or customer service? I’m curious because I’m sitting straight up for both.

 

SuChin Pak  21:36

You mean Madame Tussauds Wax Museum?

 

Lamar Woods  21:41

The one and only, to South Hollywood I was running that place I was the man out there you know saying they call me Mr. Wax. I used to walk in with a briefcase in his suit. It can be big wax out there. I was wax, I was wax tested. I was I was waxing on not all babies.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  22:02

That’s right and you watch it on about customers service.

 

SuChin Pak  22:06

The lines are going dead. We got to drop in the lines.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  22:12

We’re dropping the lines and we’re trying to drop the panties alright let’s move away from customers service.

 

SuChin Pak  22:17

Let’s move away from from Mr. Wax customer service.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  22:22

Let’s get away, let’s get into your cart. I think this is going to bring us back because Lamar is adding to cart any kind of spa treatments.

 

Lamar Woods  22:33

Yes, yeah.

 

SuChin Pak  22:34

Let’s dive. What do you mean by that?

 

Lamar Woods  22:37

Yeah, I’m new to this so this so you guys can help me if you enter spas and stuff. So I got into this over the pandemic because I was like I just had a lot of background and so I was I went to the spa I went to get a massage and at Four Seasons in Beverly Hills it was just blew me away. I’ll tell you that.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  22:58

That lives are lighting up live callers are all gonna.

 

Lamar Woods  23:04

Wax man is who I have though, you know saying if you if you can’t if you can’t love me as a wax on the first day.

 

SuChin Pak  23:13

That layer must be revealed to only the sacred ones. You know what I mean? Like we, that’s worse people are going to love you for the wax man. But that’s live here in a little bit of Prada and four seasons massages go on.

 

Lamar Woods  23:29

So yeah, four seasons, I will go there in the afternoon, it was a beautiful thing so I’ll go get the massage and I it was my first I mean my first time I just was blown away and the girl who did she’s like she’s the one who teaches everyone else I just got lucky that I got like the main person. And I was it was just like amazing. So then I go into the the sauna and steam room all that for me, you know, black dude from Atlanta like this just wasn’t a thing I was exposed to so yeah, I feel it feels like obvious in some on some level but also it’s like no, I just never done this before. So that was like you know 2020, and then now I’m like now I’m just I’m hitting up different spots I’m up at Raven spa, Raven spa got oh, they got you know they got you feel like you outside but you inside as well. And in terms of like products I haven’t that’s where I’m moved, that’s why I was asking you on another podcast collab about face, like face moisturizer, skincare and stuff but I think anything in that world I’m fascinated by and I’m trying to get better at it, as I started doing. I want to start to get more into pedicures manicures anything like self care related. I’m into that stuff, yeah, that’s why.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  24:40

I ap[plaud you. I mean to kind of tag on that. You’re also adding to cart quality tequila. With that, well tequila at the bar.

 

SuChin Pak  24:51

Yeah, take us on this journey. Where did you start and where are we today on this tequila?

 

Lamar Woods  24:56

Okay, it’s all started, you know, it always starts with, they may be out some rappers shit in Atlanta’s like patrolling or whatever, you don’t know what the hell’s going on. And then I’m like a kid then it was like, oh casamigos is the shit. Like Castlevania has like a tense so much additives to it and like sugar and stuff. And this was this this came about because I was like, I couldn’t figure out a drink, like, maybe I should just not drink the older I get, you know, I’m in my late 30s now, and I was like, I’m just like, not recovering well, and I’m like, I’m like, what is my drink and be like, I just want what like, how about James Bond has his one drink martini or whatever. I just want like a drink that I get when I go out, that’s not gonna fuck me up. And it ended up being tequila. So now but then I was like doing Casamigos and I was still feeling sick or not sick but just like hungover and I was like, oh, just sugar in there. So then now we’re at the where I’m at now is Don Julio is pretty good, every bar kind of has that. Then we got Fortaleza, which is amazing. And this one called Ojo, Tequila Ojo, which is my favorite tequila of all time, I love that, I love that one it’s so smooth and I just yeah, just drink either neat or with a big rock, if they have the big rock. Some places they’ll be having a big rock, I like to big rock. I don’t like a lot of little rock because.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  26:15

Ice, without that craft ice, it’s gonna dilute your […] chill.

 

Lamar Woods  26:21

It wet.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  26:23

Water down, you’re not gonna get the properties of the Ojo.

 

Lamar Woods  26:27

It goes from Ojo to uno, a wave of like it’s it’s all stuff. I don’t tell people I like because also not working right now. So I shouldn’t be doing any of this. But going back to highly sensitive thing. I really just don’t like ice and my drink like a little a lot of ice because it’s my teeth, it makes my mouth sensitive. I don’t like the way it feels like, like I have to drink with a straw. I think that’s the HSP me, or do you feel that way to do like, drinking from cups with a bunch of?

 

SuChin Pak  27:03

No, I’m not, it’s clumsy.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  27:05

You don’t like it?

 

SuChin Pak  27:07

Wow.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  27:07

Look.

 

Lamar Woods  27:08

Yeah, all the ice comes history of the gum, your gums and stuff. I don’t like that unless it’s a big rock.

 

SuChin Pak  27:13

It’s unpredictable. I’m there with you. I’d also teeth. Teeth are important as we get older, again, we’re dropping the lines. Now I’m just cooling off all the live. As you get older, you got to protect your teeth. And so yeah, every dentist will tell you drink with a straw.

 

Lamar Woods  27:33

Oh, really? All right so now I don’t feel as bad because I always I feel like they always look at me funny when I ask first because it seems like I mean, I get that not in the environment says but it just I think it’s like a masculinity thing going on where they’re like, I’m like gonna have a straw please, and they always look at me like, why?

 

Kulap Vilaysack  27:50

Well, that, well, I think we need to I mean, I think we need to put this on the list for therapy. Let’s put the straw let’s put it on, and maybe it’s later, maybe top of my list.

 

Lamar Woods  28:04

Same for me. What’s your drink of choice, Ku?

 

Lamar Woods  28:04

Because I’ll be at a bar with the homies like, like Carl and all my homies and they all they all drink and they drink straight from the glass. And then I’m over here and like sipping on the straw. And I’m like, I’m just trying to protect my teeth right here. Okay, so there’s one more tequila really just discovered that I’m liking now. Oh class, this class Class A class, but that that’s one I love I dragged that on my album release party. I just drank that whole I drink that whole bottle which is crazy. And I felt nothing. I woke up great, which is not normal for me so I was like, it does seem like the higher quality tequila, the better for my body it is or whatever I’m responding to it better.

 

Lamar Woods  28:10

I do like the tequila and also to kilo plus a little bit of mushroom chocolate. And that’ll take me in the perfect party mood. And I will not be hungover the next day.

 

Lamar Woods  29:04

That sounds really fun. A little mushroom and.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  29:07

It’s a little bit a little mushroom instant tequila, little umami with my Agave.

 

SuChin Pak  29:16

What is that personality? I’m just curious that comes out. I love it. Love more I don’t drink and so often which is a shame people don’t drink around me. I prefer it when people are drunk around me. It’s much more fun for me. But I don’t get to see everybody’s you know what I mean? Agave mushroom personalities as much so who what what’s what’s your personality?

 

Kulap Vilaysack  29:40

Yeah, so this is going to fuel going to the club. That’s me and that’s what is being asked of me because I normally go to bed and try to be in bed by 11 but that’s not what’s gonna happen and Minami for Miami Beach pride. So when I’m being called to do for the people is to give life of the part, to give classy ratchet that deteriorates. Yes ratchet, and that slides down, but everybody knows it’s gonna happen. And we’re all like we’re just waiting for the inevitable but we need to be at a high frequency to.

 

Lamar Woods  30:17

Stop man we’re so similar, I that’s exactly how I would I am yeah.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  30:21

Yeah, Lamar would what’s your, what’s your.

 

Lamar Woods  30:24

Exactly Kulap, like I go I start really like clap oh you said classy,

 

Kulap Vilaysack  30:29

Classy ratchet, you know.

 

Lamar Woods  30:31

Classy ratchet. I’m like, yo, let’s get the Viet let’s get the booth. Let’s you know let’s let’s get settled down. Everyone makes sure they even a glass of wine to start maybe like a glass of champagne to start off, and then we hit the tequila. And then by the end of the night, I’m just like, I got my shirt off.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  30:48

Bottoms off, shirts off.

 

Lamar Woods  30:50

Yeah, we poppin bottles. I’m using I’m also the person who’s buying ship for everyone like stranger like yo, yo, I want to drink I want to take a shot, I’m just like doing that, and then it’s just like a completely different person. I wonder if our rachet is looking like, like my ratchet looks like, I’m trying to think of an Atlanta rapper. But yeah, like, like Jermaine Dupri or something. That’s like, that’s what I’ve been covering oh, I feel like.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  31:14

I think they would go well together. If not the same, I feel like they would run they would it would be like, yeah, there would be cousins, they would think it would be in the same VIP. We would be like, you know, it’s not just about us. It’s about everybody’s experience. I believe that as well.

 

Lamar Woods  31:31

Yeah, I bet, it’s like we’re it’s like I’m not having a good time, unless everyone is having a good time. You know, it’s like, it’s kind of like my Luther King said, you know, we’re not we can’t survive, if it’s just us. It has to be everybody. We have to have justice for everyone.

 

SuChin Pak  31:52

And that is why we still honor the great king.

 

Lamar Woods  31:56

Yeah.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  31:58

You know.

 

Lamar Woods  31:58

If I’m gonna turn up if I’m turning up with some shots, I want everyone at the bars right this shots. All right, I’m silly today sorry, yeah.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  32:08

No, no apologies.

 

SuChin Pak  32:11

I love being your crack human. Can I always be your first human of the day is amazing.

 

Lamar Woods  32:24

I just imagine that you have this cat. You have a cat spray, just like put it in the cart, like I that’s how I imagine.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  32:31

Look, Tiffany, can we cut that as a clip from now on that we would Lamar’s voice saying put it in the cart.

 

Lamar Woods  32:39

Here we gotta get it clean, are you ready?

 

Kulap Vilaysack  32:41

Okay, go.

 

Lamar Woods  32:42

Put it in the cart.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  32:49

Let’s talk about things you’re removing from carts.

 

Lamar Woods  32:51

Oh, yeah cool.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  32:53

And I want to know, why are you removing? We chopped specifically, overcomplicated?

 

SuChin Pak  33:00

What is that?

 

Lamar Woods  33:00

Oh, I don’t like okay, there’s two way shots by my house. The one I used to go is just like a kind of a hole in the wall like low key spot. You just go get the weed and get out of there. And like there’s one by my house called the set, right? And it’s like, it’s like so over the top. Like, it’s like it wants you to be like, like, you feel like you’re in a movie set. And then like you go in and it’s like and like, yeah.

 

SuChin Pak  33:27

Wow, I didn’t know that this exists the set, I now I get it.

 

Lamar Woods  33:32

Yeah, it’s becoming like, it’s just not fun to buy weed this way, that’s not really on game. Fully to like, like the like, at the end. When you go to the register it says you’re all set. Like it shouldn’t say like, that’s a wrap.

 

SuChin Pak  33:48

Yeah, one metaphor. You there metaphors and it’s.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  33:53

Yeah, cuz then what does anything mean, you know, exactly. Set match point.

 

Lamar Woods  34:02

It doesn’t make the shopping experience better, it just feels like almost like.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  34:06

It’s confusing a little, and makes you scratch your head.

 

Lamar Woods  34:09

And then you don’t know where anything is. And it’s just big, I’d rather just go to one where it’s like just helped me get the weed and and get out of there you know, I mean, like, I don’t want to spend a lot of time here. It doesn’t really the people who are creating it, smoke weed. Like, it feels like removed from the experience of smoking weed. It doesn’t feel like they’re like connecting to the soul of the weed head you know, so, but that’s a very.

 

SuChin Pak  34:34

That’s an HS POV […]

 

Lamar Woods  34:39

I like that. That’s an HSP POV.

 

SuChin Pak  34:43

And there’s always an HSP POV to everything in life, right?

 

SuChin Pak  34:47

My typical.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  34:47

Wow, wait Lamarr is this you know, like social media bit and said like Bill Maher’s new rules, you’re like […]

 

Lamar Woods  34:57

Yeah, that’s an HSP POV no ice, no ice to drink. Straws only HSP POV I need that thick. I didn’t, I didn’t fit candles not the long candles HSP POV.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  35:20

Taper freak me.

 

Lamar Woods  35:22

I need clothing that I need any clothing that fits me HSP all right, but honestly, I joined Tik Tok a couple weeks ago, and I have no content so this might be perfect for that.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  35:37

Anything this appearance has been a real workout for us all.

 

Lamar Woods  35:41

Yeah, I love that and that helped promote the album was great. Yesterday, my manager I think.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  35:48

Oh Su.

 

SuChin Pak  35:51

I mean, I think all I have no idea why I only yes, exactly. I just want to be your your auntie and the first human, I have no interest in managing anything other than everything.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  36:01

Yeah, we just want to give our opinions with this the sort of the freedom of not having really any continence.

 

SuChin Pak  36:09

Or factual evidence backing up.

 

Lamar Woods  36:12

No, there’s like, it’s like, no follow up it is it’s.

 

SuChin Pak  36:15

No zero.

 

Lamar Woods  36:16

After we hit me up is like you should take this vitamin, but then, you know, she’ll never follow up to see if I actually.

 

SuChin Pak  36:23

We have it’s on the call only goes one way. You know, we have very specific specific communication devices goes out outgoing calls only.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  36:37

Before we let you leave, you are also removing from cart air, is it Airbnbs or Airbnbs? Or Airbnbs?

 

SuChin Pak  36:45

Airbnbs my favorite topic go.

 

Lamar Woods  36:51

I just don’t like them anymore. They I feel like something happened. Whatever the whatever this sort of, like cache nature I had when we when they first started and was cool. That’s just gone now, it’s just like I’m in someone’s house. It just feels weird, and then also, I feel like a lot of Airbnbs and maybe I’m a part of the problem here, because I’m just a people pleaser, and I always get five stars, but like, I feel like they get really aggressive after you stay there like please review like they’re like, and like let’s say it was fine, like it wasn’t amazing, everything, it was just a fine thing. But then they’re hitting me up like you got to review he got to review a key please, and then I just like end up giving him five stars, and I think everyone’s doing that and now like the rating system is kind of not working as well because you’re like, oh, I go to I cuz I always look at reviews before I go. And they’re just never good, the never as good as as it’s saying online, I think is in conjunction with me re falling in love with hotels again. And like cool like artsy hotels like the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs, that’s my favorite. The lines getting back up and my hair and alive, the other girls call it. All right, I’ll tell you if I was Atlanta, I’d be married by now. But y’all feel me on Airbnb thing, like I think.

 

SuChin Pak  38:08

100%

 

Lamar Woods  38:08

I feel more bad than the weed thing, yeah.

 

SuChin Pak  38:11

I think to, it goes back to your thing about customer service. And and you get to a certain point in life where you’re just priorities change you know, like, I think when you’re younger and you’re doing an Airbnb to save money, I get it. You know what I mean? Like, there’s a lot of reasons that that works or you get to a certain point you have, maybe you have kids that you have to take care of all of these things, and suddenly, your priorities are different. You need customer service. I have had such horror stories with Airbnb, especially with kids, they have zero customer service. In the end, you really don’t have that much recourse when you walk into a place and you’re like, oh, no, this is this is a crime scene. I can’t see here, and I’ve just got off a flight, it’s 2am, where the hell am I supposed to go?

 

Lamar Woods  38:57

I’m not making this up, there was an entire family living under the house like, like, it was like I rent this Airbnb in Malibu. I walk I don’t know, what was it, like, maybe it gave me chills like because I walked out. It was a very beautiful house because on the cliff in the hills and in Malibu, I walked down because I wanted to hike and go see the nature and stuff. And I look over and there’s just a guy with his shirt off like eating soup on the porch. And I’m like, who the fuck is that? Like? So then I hit up the ladies, I’m like, who is that? And she’s like, they take care of the grounds or whatever. And I’m like, no, this it was like a full last family. Like this was not they were not working, it was like it was like it was like a father a son, and then we can hear them arguing in the middle of the night, they were like fighting with each other. I mean, they didn’t come into the house, but they definitely were like, like, you know, living like like habitat.

 

SuChin Pak  39:54

No, and that’s not what you want when you’re on vacation.

 

Kulap Vilaysack  39:57

You’re working […]
