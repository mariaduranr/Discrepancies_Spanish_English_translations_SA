Oh, I just wanted to be an actor, I wanted to be an actress, I wanted to be musicals, I wanted to be all these things. And I was so mad at my mom. She only let me be in school plays but you know what I was in school plays and it panned out great. I’m reading a diary entry. I kept a diary a meticulous diary. But like when I was like 12 and 13 so it’s not like the deepest shit but it’s you know, and one is like, mom will let me sign up for […] on which was like child models or whatever, just pay this, you know fee and we’ll get you or kids into modeling or whatever and of course, my mom was like, That’s bullshit, and you’re not doing it no. I wrote my diary because I knew someone would read it someday and know how abusive she was. Mom won’t let me do […] on. But um, you know, I did school plays, and it was awesome. And I was so into it, and I took an acting class. And there’s lots of stuff you can do at 9 and 10 and 11. You know, you could do that local plays, community theater, school plays. And I think your mom’s probably right in it seems like, for ever from now, before you are, you know, 18 and can make your own decisions or whatever it is, childhood takes forever, because, like, the first seven years of your life is your whole life. But like, to me seven years ago was like, oh, yeah, seven years ago, it was like, I was a comedian, I was doing that, you know, it was like, nothing ago. As you get older, life gets shorter. So I understand like, it feels like forever. But, you know, you know what I would do? I would be in my room and I would read monologues and I would, you know, I would do Emily, not you, but Emily, the character Emily and in our town, and she has a big monologue in the third act, and I would read it in my room, and I would, you know, I’d make stuff up with my friends. And you don’t have to be an earner, you don’t have to be making a living at nine. And you know, one thing I do disagree with your mom, is that these kids are spoiled brats. They might seem like spoiled brats, they’re children, working, like working a job like adults. It’s long hours, it seems very glamorous and fun. And because the only part that you see is the fun part. But it’s long and boring. And you’re not with your friends. And some kids thrive. Some kids thrive and then hit a real hard wall. You know, you’ll be right for and to answer your question. I do work with kids and I have worked with kids and I’m working with kids on this musical the bed wetter because it stars a 10 year old me. And boy, the rejection these kids go through is on another level. And a lot of kids it affects them in a negative way. Some kids thrive and you know, a they grow up to be Jodie Foster, they grew up to be Ron Howard or they grew up to be Selena Gomez. But um, a lot really don’t make it out well, you know, and to have like a real childhood to base the rest of your acting career on to actually have lived experience that isn’t on a film set or a TV set. You don’t want to hear it now and it doesn’t seem real now but they promise it will be worth it. God I couldn’t wait. I could not wait to be an adult and get to be an actor. And even then you don’t necessarily get to be an actor. I got lucky I was a stand up I you know, but that said I will say there are these New York kids, you know, that are Broadway veterans and they you know, the young woman who played me in the Off Broadway Run, Zoe Glick was beyond brilliant. I mean, she was like a tiny Meryl Streep. She didn’t she wasn’t naturally like a little me. She built this character. from the inside out. I watched it happen. And it was mind blowing. This kid is going to be have whatever career she wants, but we couldn’t use her anymore. For the crime of growing, she’s like 14, 15 now. And it was heartbreaking. Because I would have had her forever if I could. But the part is for a little kid. And what happens is, she aged out. Now she’ll age into other roles. She’ll play teenagers and she’ll play you know, older kids. But I can’t imagine what that’s like to she carried this show, this musical. It was all on her shoulders and she was absolutely brilliant. Brilliant and she grew out of it. She didn’t do anything wrong, she did everything right. I don’t know what the right thing is I, you know, I want to support you beat you. Listen, no one’s keeping you from being an artist. No one’s keeping you from performing monologues at dinner, or working on your craft or taking acting lessons or being in local plays. That’s what I did. And if you care about the craft, and it’s not just like, I want to be famous, which is not a craft, then you’ll love doing it. You know, doesn’t matter if the audience is five people or 5 million people. It’s about the craft of acting. And that’s what you are passionate about, right? There’s so much to learn. I mean, part of learning, acting is watching people, or, or listening into the table next to you at a restaurant or on the bus. You know, listening to conversations and thinking, this is real life. And as an actor, I want to capture what that is, I want to really be able to show what real life looks like you know, and study people and watch a million movies, and find out what kind of acting is interesting to you and watch different actors and how they play different roles. There’s so much to do in the next nine years for you to prepare yourself. Live life, observe people and have experiences, you know, if you can be in a local play or your school, play, do it all. But all of it feeds into your future. It’s all preparation. It’s all the stuff you draw on. You only have one childhood. Everything that’s happening right now in your life is the stuff you’re going to be drawing from as an actor. So you’ve already started, and your mom is probably doing the right thing. And I know you won’t understand it now. But you will, alright, what else? --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters",

      "\u001b[1;31mNotValidLength\u001b[0m: Oh, this is so hard. I don’t know how to answer this Emily because I was you at your age. Oh, I just wanted to be an actor, I wanted to be an actress, I wanted to be musicals, I wanted to be all these things. And I was so mad at my mom. She only let me be in school plays but you know what I was in school plays and it panned out great. I’m reading a diary entry. I kept a diary a meticulous diary. But like when I was like 12 and 13 so it’s not like the deepest shit but it’s you know, and one is like, mom will let me sign up for […] on which was like child models or whatever, just pay this, you know fee and we’ll get you or kids into modeling or whatever and of course, my mom was like, That’s bullshit, and you’re not doing it no. I wrote my diary because I knew someone would read it someday and know how abusive she was. Mom won’t let me do […] on. But um, you know, I did school plays, and it was awesome. And I was so into it, and I took an acting class. And there’s lots of stuff you can do at 9 and 10 and 11. You know, you could do that local plays, community theater, school plays. And I think your mom’s probably right in it seems like, for ever from now, before you are, you know, 18 and can make your own decisions or whatever it is, childhood takes forever, because, like, the first seven years of your life is your whole life. But like, to me seven years ago was like, oh, yeah, seven years ago, it was like, I was a comedian, I was doing that, you know, it was like, nothing ago. As you get older, life gets shorter. So I understand like, it feels like forever. But, you know, you know what I would do? I would be in my room and I would read monologues and I would, you know, I would do Emily, not you, but Emily, the character Emily and in our town, and she has a big monologue in the third act, and I would read it in my room, and I would, you know, I’d make stuff up with my friends. And you don’t have to be an earner, you don’t have to be making a living at nine. And you know, one thing I do disagree with your mom, is that these kids are spoiled brats. They might seem like spoiled brats, they’re children, working, like working a job like adults. It’s long hours, it seems very glamorous and fun. And because the only part that you see is the fun part. But it’s long and boring. And you’re not with your friends. And some kids thrive. Some kids thrive and then hit a real hard wall. You know, you’ll be right for and to answer your question. I do work with kids and I have worked with kids and I’m working with kids on this musical the bed wetter because it stars a 10 year old me. And boy, the rejection these kids go through is on another level. And a lot of kids it affects them in a negative way. Some kids thrive and you know, a they grow up to be Jodie Foster, they grew up to be Ron Howard or they grew up to be Selena Gomez. But um, a lot really don’t make it out well, you know, and to have like a real childhood to base the rest of your acting career on to actually have lived experience that isn’t on a film set or a TV set. You don’t want to hear it now and it doesn’t seem real now but they promise it will be worth it. God I couldn’t wait. I could not wait to be an adult and get to be an actor. And even then you don’t necessarily get to be an actor. I got lucky I was a stand up I you know, but that said I will say there are these New York kids, you know, that are Broadway veterans and they you know, the young woman who played me in the Off Broadway Run, Zoe Glick was beyond brilliant. I mean, she was like a tiny Meryl Streep. She didn’t she wasn’t naturally like a little me. She built this character. from the inside out. I watched it happen. And it was mind blowing. This kid is going to be have whatever career she wants, but we couldn’t use her anymore. For the crime of growing, she’s like 14, 15 now. And it was heartbreaking. Because I would have had her forever if I could. But the part is for a little kid. And what happens is, she aged out. Now she’ll age into other roles. She’ll play teenagers and she’ll play you know, older kids. But I can’t imagine what that’s like to she carried this show, this musical. It was all on her shoulders and she was absolutely brilliant. Brilliant and she grew out of it. She didn’t do anything wrong, she did everything right. I don’t know what the right thing is I, you know, I want to support you beat you. Listen, no one’s keeping you from being an artist. No one’s keeping you from performing monologues at dinner, or working on your craft or taking acting lessons or being in local plays. That’s what I did. And if you care about the craft, and it’s not just like, I want to be famous, which is not a craft, then you’ll love doing it. You know, doesn’t matter if the audience is five people or 5 million people. It’s about the craft of acting. And that’s what you are passionate about, right? There’s so much to learn. I mean, part of learning, acting is watching people, or, or listening into the table next to you at a restaurant or on the bus. You know, listening to conversations and thinking, this is real life. And as an actor, I want to capture what that is, I want to really be able to show what real life looks like you know, and study people and watch a million movies, and find out what kind of acting is interesting to you and watch different actors and how they play different roles. There’s so much to do in the next nine years for you to prepare yourself. Live life, observe people and have experiences, you know, if you can be in a local play or your school, play, do it all. But all of it feeds into your future. It’s all preparation. It’s all the stuff you draw on. You only have one childhood. Everything that’s happening right now in your life is the stuff you’re going to be drawing from as an actor. So you’ve already started, and your mom is probably doing the right thing. And I know you won’t understand it now. But you will, alright, what else? --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters"
