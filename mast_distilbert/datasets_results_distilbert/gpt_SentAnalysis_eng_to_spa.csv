"6. Hi, Sarah, this is Kelly, and I wanted to ask you about long-term goals. I am a 44-year-old small business owner, and I want to know how you handle long-term goals. Because for me, they feel kind of moot since we're not in control of everything, so I look to the future. Like, by 64, I want to sell my business or retirethat's 20 years away. But then I think about all the things that can happen in 20 years, especially with how unstable everything is right now. So I struggle with setting these long-term goals. And I even struggle with the short-term goals to reach that long-term goal, if that makes any sense. I just wanted to get your opinion on that. And to see how you, as a business owner and media personality, handle this because you always have great advice. Thank you for your entertaining comedy and advice. It's something I look forward to every Thursday morning when I walk my dog, Biscuit. So, thank you, and I hope to hear from you soon.","6. Hola, Sarah, soy Kelly y quería preguntarte sobre metas a largo plazo. Soy propietaria de una pequeña empresa, tengo 44 años y quiero saber cómo manejas las metas a largo plazo. Porque para mí, parecen un poco inútiles ya que no controlamos todo, así que miro hacia el futuro. Como que a los 64, quiero vender mi negocio o jubilarme, eso es en 20 años. Pero luego pienso en todas las cosas que pueden suceder en 20 años, especialmente con lo inestable que está todo ahora. Así que lucho con establecer estas metas a largo plazo. E incluso me esfuerzo con las metas a corto plazo para alcanzar esa meta a largo plazo, si eso tiene sentido. Solo quería obtener tu opinión al respecto. Y ver cómo tú, como propietaria de un negocio y personalidad de los medios, manejas esto porque siempre tienes buenos consejos. Gracias por tu comedia entretenida y tus consejos.

"7. Hi Biscuit, are you going to walk? Hey, Biscuit. I just wanted to play that for Biscuit. I wouldn't say I'm without goals. But I always struggle with this because they never really think about what I want to do in the next five years or so. I've come to fully understand and accept that I've never been able to predict the future, and I never will be able to. So that helps me with my anxietyjust not trying to predict the future or worry too much about how it will unfold since we never know. We've never been able to know; you've never been able to predict anything in your life, and neither have I. But in terms of long-term goals, things that I've advised friends who have asked, I would say, make a plan like you have 20 more years in your business and then retire; you're making a long-term goal. Then you follow that plan until it no longer serves you. Its either going to see you through to fruition, and everything will go as planned, or more likely, other things will happenlife will happenthat will take you in a different direction, and you'll make a new plan. Goals are great, but of course, its the journey to those goalsthat's the substance of life, and you have to hopefully enjoy that. Because whether the goal is achieved or not, the journey should be your joy. Obviously, your joy isn't just about working or not; it's about being responsible for your own happiness, which includes taking care of yourself financially. So, it's a mix of all those things. You have a long-term goal and a plan to get there, and you follow that plan until it doesn't serve you anymore, and then you make a new one. I don't know what else to say. What other advice I can give, but it sounds like youre doing great. Not fulfilling a goal isnt necessarily a failure, and failure isnt necessarily bad. So, control what you can and be on the edge of your seat for the rest. Good luck, what else?","7. Hola Biscuit, ¿vas a pasear? Hola, Biscuit. Solo quería poner eso para Biscuit. No diría que no tengo metas. Pero siempre lucho con esto porque nunca realmente pienso en lo que quiero hacer en los próximos cinco años o así. He llegado a entender y aceptar completamente que nunca he podido predecir el futuro, y nunca podré hacerlo. Eso me ayuda con mi ansiedad, simplemente no intentando predecir el futuro o preocuparme demasiado por cómo se desarrollará ya que nunca sabemos. Nunca hemos podido saberlo; nunca has podido predecir nada en tu vida, y yo tampoco. Pero en términos de metas a largo plazo, cosas que he aconsejado a amigos que han preguntado, diría, haz un plan como que tienes 20 años más en tu negocio y luego te jubilas; estás estableciendo una meta a largo plazo. Luego sigues ese plan hasta que ya no te sirva. O bien te llevará a la realización y todo saldrá como planeaste, o más probablemente, sucederán otras cosas, la vida sucederá, que te llevarán en una dirección diferente y harás un nuevo plan. Las metas son geniales, pero por supuesto, es el viaje hacia esas metas, eso es la sustancia de la vida, y esperas poder disfrutar de eso. Porque si se logra la meta o no, el viaje debe ser tu alegría. Obviamente, tu alegría no se trata solo de trabajar o no; se trata de ser responsable de tu propia felicidad, lo que incluye cuidarte financieramente. Así que es una mezcla de todas esas cosas. Tienes una meta a largo plazo y un plan para llegar allí, y sigues ese plan hasta que ya no te sirva más, y luego haces uno nuevo. No sé qué más decir. Qué otro consejo puedo dar, pero parece que lo estás haciendo genial. No cumplir una meta no es necesariamente un fracaso, y fracasar no es necesariamente malo. Entonces, controla lo que puedas y mantente al borde de tu asiento para el resto.

And then there's 'The Way of the Gun,' a movie where I appeared just in the first scene before the credits. My character was described as a raving bitch, but it was directed by Christopher McQuarrie. It was his first movie, and during the shooting, I was actually punched in the face three times; once by accident by Ryan Phillippe, even though we practiced the scene. It was an accident, and he felt awful, but it was cool. They may have used the take with the actual hit because you can hear the impact. But that's definitely a deep cut for sure.","9.

Y luego está 'The Way of the Gun,' una película donde aparecí solo en la primera escena antes de los créditos.

Fue su primera película, y durante el rodaje, Ryan Phillippe me golpeó accidentalmente en la cara tres veces; una vez por accidente aunque practicamos la escena.

And my mom thought it was nonsense and said no. I wrote in my diary because I knew someone would read it someday, and I wanted them to know how I felt. But I did school plays, and they were amazing. And there are so many things you can do at 9 or 10 or 11. You can do local plays, community theater, school plays. And I think your mom is probably right because childhood takes forever, it feels like. But there's a lot you can do nowread monologues in your room, make up stuff with your friends. And remember, you don't have to be earning a living at nine. And my opinion on child actors is not that they're spoiled brats. Theyre working long hours, it's not all fun and games, and not all kids are cut out for that. Some thrive and then hit a hard wall. As for your question, I do work with kids. I've worked with kids on a musical based on a 10-year-old version of me. The rejection these kids face can be tough, it affects them in different ways. Some kids thrive, like Jodie Foster or Ron Howard or Selena Gomez. But not all make it through well. To have a real childhood to base your acting career on is important, to have lived experiences that aren't just on a film set. It will be worth it, I promise. But I couldn't wait to be an adult and be an actor. Even then, you don't necessarily get to be an actor. I was lucky, I was a stand-up, and that worked for me. But there are New York kids, Broadway veterans, like Zoe Glick, who played me Off-Broadway. She was brilliant, like a tiny Meryl Streep. She wasn't naturally like a little me; she built the character from the inside out. She carried the show, and then she aged out. Now she'll get new roles, but that's the industry. You've already started, your mom is doing the right thing, and you'll understand it one day.","11. Oh, esto es difícil. No sé cómo responder a esto, Emily, porque yo era como tú a tu edad. Solo quería ser actriz, quería hacer musicales, quería hacerlo todo. Y estaba tan enfadada con mi madre. Solo me dejaba participar en obras escolares, pero ¿sabes qué? Participé en obras escolares, y resultó genial. Mantenía un diario meticuloso. Pero como a los 12 o 13 años, no es que fuera lo más profundo, pero era importante para mí. Hubo un tiempo, mi madre no me dejaba inscribirme en esa agencia de modelaje infantil o lo que fuera: pagabas una tarifa y se suponía que ayudarían a tus hijos a entrar en el modelaje o lo que sea. Y mi madre pensaba que era una tontería y dijo que no. Escribí en mi diario porque sabía que alguien lo leería algún día, y quería que supieran cómo me sentía. Pero hice obras escolares, y fueron increíbles. Y hay tantas cosas que puedes hacer a los 9 o 10 u 11 años. Puedes hacer obras locales, teatro comunitario, obras escolares. Y creo que tu madre probablemente tiene razón porque la infancia se siente eterna. Pero hay mucho que puedes hacer ahora: leer monólogos en tu habitación, inventar cosas con tus amigos. Y recuerda, no tienes que ganarte la vida a los nueve. Y mi opinión sobre los niños actores no es que sean niños mimados. Trabajan largas horas, no todo es diversión y juegos, y no todos los niños están hechos para eso. Algunos prosperan y luego se topan con un muro. En cuanto a tu pregunta, sí trabajo con niños. He trabajado con niños en un musical basado en una versión de mí a los 10 años. El rechazo al que se enfrentan estos niños puede ser duro, los afecta de diferentes maneras. Algunos niños prosperan, como Jodie Foster o Ron Howard o Selena Gomez. Pero no todos lo llevan bien. Tener una infancia real en la que basar tu carrera actoral es importante, tener experiencias de vida que no sean solo en un set de filmación. Valdrá la pena, lo prometo. Pero yo no podía esperar a ser adulta y ser actriz. Incluso entonces, no necesariamente llegas a ser actriz. Tuve suerte, era comediante y eso funcionó para mí. Pero hay niños de Nueva York, veteranos de Broadway, como Zoe Glick, que me interpretó en Off-Broadway. Fue brillante, como una pequeña Meryl Streep. No era naturalmente como una pequeña yo; construyó el personaje desde dentro hacia afuera. Llevó el espectáculo y luego creció demasiado para el papel. Ahora conseguirá nuevos roles, pero así es la industria. Ya has comenzado, tu madre está haciendo lo correcto, y lo entenderás algún día.",0.026573749259114265,0.0874120444059372,0.003939730580896139,0.8368303179740906,0.009178344160318375,0.03606583923101425,0.0312817208468914,0.7332452535629272,0.01107086893171072,0.1729089617729187,0.04723196104168892,0.004261191003024578

"1. Hi Sarah, my name is John and I'm calling because I just listened to your episode about fecal incontinence due to an accident. It's very common and it's horrible that she has to endure this alone. I had the same problem due to radiation for lymphoma in my lower region. I was referred to a colorectal doctor who implemented a neuromodulation stimulator. It retrained my nerves, specifically the sacral nerve. When the sacral nerve is damaged, it's like a plant that freezes in winter and dies. It stops working and you develop those types of symptoms. But the neuromodulation stimulator is a surgically implanted device, much like a pacemaker for your heart. Its like a pacemaker for your bowel movements, stimulating the sacral nerves, and I had 100% success with it and now I go about my life without constantly looking for a bathroom.","1.

"The first to vanish is Laura Smither, just 12 years old. What was Laura like? She was a joy. She was so sweet and so caring and so fiercely loyal to all her girlfriends. She was one of my best friends. We spent a lot of time together. Everybody loved Laura. She was just one of those people. I always say she was touched by light because everybody loved her. She was the friend that would come over to your house and make you look bad because she would help put away the dishes after dinner. And Laura wasn't perfect. She was a normal kid, but she was very smart, wickedly smart. She could have done anything. She would have turned 13. She'd been counting down the days for 87 days. She was so excited to become a teenager. In 1997, Friendswood was just a very quiet small town. So we're about halfway between the city of Houston and Galveston. In '97, we had been voted one of the top 10 safest cities in America. Laura lived near the creek, and their house was magical because I would go there and they would always have the computers going, and we could go outside and explore and climb trees.","La primera en desaparecer fue Laura Smither, de apenas 12 años. ¿Cómo era Laura?

Era simplemente una de esas personas. Siempre digo que estaba tocada por la luz porque todos la querían. Era la amiga que venía a tu casa y te hacía quedar mal porque ayudaba a guardar los platos después de la cena. Y Laura no era perfecta.

"There wasn't a lot of development in the area. It was a quiet country road. Laura lived on Waredare at the end. And so if we were in the kitchen, you could see right to the end of the road from inside the house. Laura wanted to be a professional ballerina. She had just accepted into the Houston Ballet Academy. Ballet was probably the most important part of her life besides her family. She loved to dance. She was always choreographing little pieces, and she'd put on little plays for us. She started when she was six. She did ballet, tap, and jazz. Wow, for six years. But she just really loved ballet more than anything. Take me back to April third, 1997. What are you doing that morning here? It was a Thursday. Because I'd been out of town, I said, Okay, we'll do Pancakes with Bacon, which was Laura's favorite. She just finished reading a book, and it was all about running and exercise and building your endurance. She felt that if she did that, she could hold her arabesque longer, and it would make her stronger ballet. And her dad was a runner. He ran every day.","No había mucho desarrollo en el área. Era un camino rural tranquilo. Laura vivía en Waredare al final. Y así si estábamos en la cocina, podías ver directamente hasta el final del camino desde dentro de la casa. Laura quería ser una bailarina profesional. Acababa de ser aceptada en la Academia de Ballet de Houston. El ballet era probablemente la parte más importante de su vida además de su familia. Le encantaba bailar. Siempre estaba coreografiando pequeñas piezas y nos hacía pequeñas obras para nosotros. Empezó cuando tenía seis años. Hacía ballet, tap y jazz. Vaya, por seis años. Pero lo que realmente amaba más que nada era el ballet. Llévame de vuelta al 3 de abril de 1997. ¿Qué estabas haciendo esa mañana aquí? Era un jueves. Porque había estado fuera de la ciudad, dije, Ok, haremos Panqueques con Tocino, que era lo favorito de Laura. Ella acabó de leer un libro, y todo era sobre correr y ejercitarse y construir tu resistencia.

"The ground search is swelling into its sixth day. Whoever has Laura, we would like you to bring her home now. Three weeks after she disappears, there's a town hall made. Just remember sitting there feeling numb. This was for my child. You need to allow the chief and the FBI some time to analyze some of the information. It was a couple of hours later before the police chief made it here to tell us that indeed a body had been found. And it was like a dark blanket just swallowed the household. We just were silent. Nobody spoke. The police left, and we just all stayed in this room all night.

It had her initials, and she was wearing her socks. It's a It's a hole. It's just a void that exists for a long time, and even now. The city was heartbroken.

"I love you. I'll see you this afternoon. On July 15, 1997, Kelly was touring the city of Denton Jail for her criminal justice class. So she comes out of the building, and what happens? She tried to get into her car. She couldn't get into it.Couldn't open the door?Couldn't open the door. The key would not work. So she walks to a nearby convenience store to call her boyfriend for help. But by the time he arrives here, Kelly is nowhere to be found. When he got there, her car was there in the parking lot.

She was seen doing the tour of the jail. They didn't have cameras on the outside. There was no cameras or anything over there at the gas station. No cameras in the immediate vicinity. They confirmed that Kelly did go inside the gas station, so they knew that she was there, but no one saw where she went. She just disappeared.

"But it was within probably 200 yards of the police station. It's pretty bold to kidnap a young woman next to a police station. It was real scary because you just don't know. It was so unlike her. She wouldn't just leave her car in abandon it. And it was at four o'clock on that day that Lawrence called me, the boyfriend called me, and asked me if I had heard from Kelly. And then when 5:30 finally rolled around, I knew Without a doubt, something bad was wrong because that's when she was supposed to pick Alexis up from the babysitter. She wouldn't have just left her. So that's when her mom knew she's missing. Something serious has gone wrong. It's like she was there one minute and then she was gone. Right from the get-go, I'm thinking somebody had to have taken her. It makes you wonder how many times the person who kidnapped her had done this. He knew the exact right moment to approach a victim.

"Investigators question Laurence Harris yesterday for four hours. Whenever you're dealing with missing persons or any type of homicide investigation, more often than not, it's someone that you know. There's rarely a situation where it's just a true whodunit. It was natural at that time to look into the boyfriend. We all want the same thing. We want her to come home safe. He had been seen in that parking lot. He was sitting there for an extended period of time. They have questioned the boyfriend, and he has passed a lie detector test. He wasn't a good suspect in the case. There are no witnesses. Her boyfriend passes the polygraph, and leads are going nowhere. They really did everything that they possibly could to generate a lead. Even the leads that were coming in, they weren't really fruitful, but no clear-cut concrete evidence about what happened to her. The case eventually went cold. So the days turned into weeks, the weeks into months, months into years. Yes. We always tried to keep the story out there. I wanted people to know it was not a soft case, and Kelly was not home.

"Yeah. And I made enough to I would fight for it. It was July 26, 1997, the day Tiffany Johnston disappeared from the sunshine car wash here in Bethany, Oklahoma. Alma. That night, she had plans to celebrate her three-month wedding anniversary with her husband. And she stopped at a car wash along the way. And she went missing. It was late at night. Was it normal for people to be washing their cars here that late? Yeah, those were the summer months. And yes, this was a very popular car wash. What happened? What did you see? So about 11:30 PM, I was heading to another call, and I drove by the car wash. There's several occupants still in the car wash, washing. I also observed a white Dodge Neon in the Far West Bay. I continued on to my call, came back about 45 minutes later, and that car was still there, no one around it, and it was the only car still there.

"Payroll check was in the console. So it didn't appear to be a robbery. It just appeared to be whoever drove the car just wasn't there.

It was the Bethany Police Department wanting to know if I knew who if need over he was. And I said, Yes, I'm her mother. And they said, Well, we found her car sitting abandoned.

"It's just that Tiffany wasn't there. We are not sure exactly what happened, but we had concerns that something bad might have happened to Tiffany. The very next day, Tiffany's partially clothved body is found in a tall patch of grass here near the interstate. She had been raped and strangled to death. It was hard to just digest that someone would want to murder her because because everybody that met her liked her. Why would somebody want to murder Tiff? I just lost it because I'm 19.

Those swaps were taken for DNA analysis, and those results were inconclusive at the time, and at that point, the case went cold.

Esas muestras se tomaron para análisis de ADN, y esos resultados fueron inconclusos en el momento, y en ese punto, el caso se enfrió. Ahora, hay tres casos, Laura y Tiffany encontradas asesinadas, y Kelly todavía desaparecida. Manejado por tres departamentos de policía diferentes a lo largo de la carretera interestatal, no hay sentido de que estos casos estén relacionados. Luego, cuatro semanas más tarde.

"She did plays in elementary, junior high, high school. And so she'd been at the drama house for two or three years, playing different events. And what were her dreams? What did she want to do? Jessica wanted to study criminology. Her immediate plans were to go to college? Mm-hmm. Did she get to attend one college class? No, she was starting the next week. Tell us about August 1997 and the play she was acting in. She was in a musical, Song for the Fifteen.

How pretty she looked, how excited she was. I went up to tell her how proud I was of her. And the last thing she said to me was, I love you, Daddy. After the play was over with, the cast members went to have dinner at Benningon's Restaurant. She was driving her dad's white Ford pickup truck.

"I had stayed up in the recliner and was waiting up for her, and I dozed off to sleep, and it was about 2:30, I guess, when I woke up and I realized she wasn't here. And that's when I immediately began to panic. She woke me up and I just jumped out of and hit the road looking for her.

But as she starts driving there, she notices she's got a flat tire.

He comes up behind her with a large honey knife and puts it to her neck and tells him to get into the truck or he's going to kill her. She gets in the truck. He starts driving north on I-45. He's driving at a high rate of speed. He was holding her down, told her to take off her pants. So it was clear to her that he was going to sexually assault her. She then said, I can't take my pants off because my shoes are off. I have to take my shoes off. So he lets go of her leg, and as soon as he did that, she opened the truck door. She felt like that was her only chance that she was going to be killed one way or the other, and this was her only chance to possibly get away.

"Fearing that there could be a serial rapist on the lose. Investigators bring in a police officer who's trained in hypnosis. It was the very first time this unconventional tool was used by the Webster Police Department. She was so traumatized. There was very little she could recall. As you relax and let go, in the very process of relaxing, you will gradually drift into hypnosis. For more than two hours, they painstakingly go through every detail of the crime. Did he make you feel in trouble? Just ask me. During her hypnosis, I asked her to describe the inside of the vehicle. That half-day is not what happens. What color is that? You have even a picture of it. A statue of a parent. What's the name? She was able to recall some details through the hypnosis and gave a description of the vehicle and the suspect. Incredibly, with the help from the hypnotist, police narrowed their search to one man. He was a predator on the trial, constantly hunting. The predator remains at large, but the hypnosis session proves crucial. In a race against time, police flipped the script. The hunter is now the hunting. Can't allow boys to get in the truck.","Temiendo que pudiera haber un violador en serie suelto, los investigadores trajeron a un oficial de policía entrenado en hipnosis.

A medida que te relajas y te dejas llevar, en el mismo proceso de relajarte, irás entrando gradualmente en hipnosis. Durante más de dos horas, revisaron meticulosamente cada detalle del crimen. ¿Te hizo sentir en peligro? Solo pregúntame. Durante su hipnosis, le pedí que describiera el interior del vehículo. Ese medio día no es lo que sucede. ¿Qué color es eso? Incluso tienes una imagen de ello. Una estatua de un padre. ¿Cómo se llama? Ella pudo recordar algunos detalles a través de la hipnosis y dio una descripción del vehículo y del sospechoso. Increíblemente, con la ayuda del hipnotizador, la policía redujo su búsqueda a un hombre. Era un depredador en la pista, cazando constantemente. El depredador sigue libre, pero la sesión de hipnosis resultó crucial. En una carrera contra el tiempo, la policía cambió el guion. El cazador ahora es el cazado.

"She's found murdered 17 days later. That July, two other young women go missing farther north, Kelly Cox in Denton, outside of Dallas, and Tiffany Johnston in a suburb of Oklahoma City. Then in August, Jessica Caine disappears off I-45 just north of Galveston. And it's that very same roadway, I-45, that connects these disappearances. In each case, authorities have very little to go on, but they are not giving up. Laura is no longer just a name in Friendswood. It's a battle cry, a battle cry to find a killer. What the public doesn't know is that investigators working on Laura Smithers murder quickly have someone in their sights. Very early on, there was a suspect that was developed.Right from the start.Right from the start. His name was William Reese. William Rees He was a Jack of all trades. He was a truck driver. He operated heavy equipment. He shoot horses. William Reese had a history of kidnapping people. William Reece had been convicted in Oklahoma in the '80s of kidnapping and sexual assault. He was supposed to serve a 25-year sentence. He ended up getting out after nine and a half years of that sentence on an appeal.","Fue encontrada asesinada 17 días después.

"William Louis Reece was released October 18, 1996 from Oklahoma Department of Corrections. He was working at a construction site next door, essentially, to where Laura's house was. That morning, he was dismissed early from a construction site because the ground was too wet. It had been raining. And drove down the same road that Laura had been out for a jog on. It would have taken William Rees in direct path with Laura Smith the morning of April the third. Well, as soon as they found out that he had kidnapped a female in Oklahoma, a sexually assaulted her. That opened your eyes up pretty quickly. They talked to him, did an interview.Early on?Early on. He consented to a search of his vehicle. They took photographs of the inside of the vehicle, collected fingerprint evidence. They collected fibers from floor mats and seats. The FBI conducted a polygraph test, which was inconclusive. There were other people on the radar earlier that were being looked at closer for a while, but he was the primary suspect. There was reasons not to announce that. Still Behind the scenes, the Friends with Authority is heading up the Smither investigation are willing to discuss their suspect.","William Louis Reece fue liberado el 18 de octubre de 1996 por el Departamento de Correcciones de Oklahoma. Estaba trabajando en una obra de construcción al lado, esencialmente, de donde vivía Laura. Esa mañana, lo despidieron temprano de la obra de construcción porque el suelo estaba demasiado húmedo. Había estado lloviendo. Y condujo por la misma carretera por la que Laura había salido a correr. Eso habría llevado a William Reece directamente por el camino de Laura Smith la mañana del tercer día de abril. Bueno, tan pronto como descubrieron que él había secuestrado a una mujer en Oklahoma, a la cual había agredido sexualmente. Eso te abre los ojos bastante rápido.

"And that's how a fateful connection between Laura Smithers' case and the Sandra Sapaw kidnapping is made in October, when Sue Patrick Nance, the detective who had hypnotized Sandra, stops by the Friendswood Police Department. I spoke with the chief there, and he told me about who they suspected, and I He left his office, went home, and about three o'clock in the morning, I woke up and I thought, Oh, my God. That's who Sandra Saipal described was William Reese. The suspect was a thin cowboy who wore a cowboy hat. He drove a large white duty pickup truck. There was a notepad or what she thought was some type of notepad or calendar on the dashboard. Sue Dietrich-Nance immediately connects investigators from Friendswood and the neighboring town of Webster, where Sandra was taken. Friendswood Police Department had already processed William Reese's vehicle, so they were able to confirm that his vehicle was consistent with what Sandra Saint Paul had described being the vehicle that had abducted her. They brought Reece in as part of a live lineup. There's a one-way mirror where they come in where Sandra is sitting on the opposite side of the glass. Okay, if you all would get shoulder-shoulder.","Y así es como se hace una conexión fatal entre el caso de Laura Smithers y el secuestro de Sandra Sapaw en octubre, cuando Sue Patrick Nance, la detective que había hipnotizado a Sandra, pasa por el Departamento de Policía de Friendswood. Hablé con el jefe allí, y él me contó sobre quién sospechaban, y yo salí de su oficina, me fui a casa y como a las tres de la mañana, me desperté y pensé, oh, Dios mío. Ese es quien Sandra Saipal describió, era William Reese. El sospechoso era un vaquero delgado que llevaba un sombrero de vaquero. Manejaba una gran camioneta blanca de trabajo. Había una libreta o lo que ella pensó que era algún tipo de libreta o calendario en el tablero. Sue Dietrich-Nance conecta inmediatamente a los investigadores de Friendswood y el pueblo vecino de Webster, donde se llevó a Sandra. El Departamento de Policía de Friendswood ya había procesado el vehículo de William Reese, por lo que pudieron confirmar que su vehículo coincidía con lo que Sandra Saint Paul había descrito como el vehículo que la había secuestrado.

Do not scream. Okay, a loud voice. Get in the truck. Get in the truck. A loud voice, I'll kill you, bitch. I'll kill you, bitch. Sandra was able to pick Reese out of the lineup. She recognized him, recognized his voice. Webster police arrested Reese at his home on Fauna Street, Thursday. Detectives say that arrest has almost picture-perfect ties to the Smither case. Just after his arrest for Sandra's kidnapping, friends with authorities publicly name Reese as the prime suspect in Laura Smithers' murder. We are confident That over the weeks ahead, that evidence will link him to our case and lead to what we have all been aiming for, a successful prosecution and conviction. Ultimately, testing does link Reese to Laura's body. There are fibers on her socks that match the floor mats of his truck and a blanket found in his apartment. Unfortunately, the evidence was not enough to convince the Harris County district Attorney's office to file charges in the death of Laura Smith.","Uno tras otro, tras otro.

Estamos seguros de que, en las semanas siguientes, las pruebas lo vincularán a nuestro caso y llevarán a lo que todos hemos estado buscando, una acusación y condena exitosas. Finalmente, las pruebas sí vinculan a Reese con el cuerpo de Laura. Hay fibras en sus calcetines que coinciden con las alfombrillas de su camión y una manta encontrada en su apartamento.

"In the end, the jury takes little more than seven hours to decide Reece's fate. The verdict has just come in. William Reece has been sentenced to 60 years behind bars. Reece said he didn't expect such a long sentence. 60 years? Did that surprise you? Oh, yeah. What did you expect? More leniency. Oh, no. You really didn't expect him to be convicted?

It turns out there had been a potential suspect, William Reece. Several months after Tiffany was taken from the Sunshine car wash and raped and murdered, investigators in Oklahoma had gotten a tip from Texas authorities. When Reece was arrested for kidnapping Sandra Sepaw, the woman who got away, he claimed that police were not only trying to frame him for Laura Smithers' death, but that they were also trying to pin Tiffany's murder on him. Without that phone call, William Reece wouldn't had been on our radar screen.","Fue una gran sorpresa cuando nos dijeron que faltaba. La noche más difícil de tu vida.

Varios meses después de que Tiffany fue tomada del lavado de autos Sunshine y violada y asesinada, los investigadores en Oklahoma recibieron una pista de las autoridades de Texas. Cuando Reece fue arrestado por secuestrar a Sandra Sepaw, la mujer que escapó, afirmó que la policía no solo estaba tratando de incriminarlo por la muerte de Laura Smithers, sino que también estaban tratando de atribuirle el asesinato de Tiffany.

"That's not a name that the investigators at the time had even heard of. Detectives in Texas also say they can place Reece in Oklahoma the night Tiffany disappeared. Investigators early on developed a timeline with William Reese, using his phone records, his gas receipts, showing what days he traveled up and down I-45 from Houston to Oklahoma. Their phone call had been made from a pay phone the night that Tiffany came up missing, and it was from the Yukon area, which is just west of where Tiffany was reported missing and just east of where her body was located. William Reece immediately becomes a person of interest, but that's the closest investigators could put him to the crime scene. The The car wash owner recognized him as being a customer there at the car wash, but that particular day, there wasn't anyone that could put him there. To be truthful with you, I had no idea what I was I want to do with the case. The only hope I had, there was one item of evidence that with new DNA technology that might be able to be tested. There were some swaps left from the original analysis.","Ese no era un nombre que los investigadores en ese momento hubieran escuchado. Los detectives en Texas también dicen que pueden ubicar a Reece en Oklahoma la noche en que Tiffany desapareció. Los investigadores desarrollaron una cronología con William Reese desde el principio, utilizando sus registros telefónicos, sus recibos de gasolina, mostrando qué días viajó de arriba abajo por la I-45 desde Houston hasta Oklahoma. Su llamada telefónica se había hecho desde un teléfono público la noche que Tiffany desapareció, y fue desde el área de Yukon, que está justo al oeste de donde Tiffany fue reportada como desaparecida y justo al este de donde se encontró su cuerpo. William Reece se convierte inmediatamente en una persona de interés, pero eso es lo más cerca que los investigadores podían ponerlo en la escena del crimen. El dueño del autolavado lo reconoció como cliente allí en el autolavado, pero ese día en particular, no había nadie que pudiera ubicarlo allí.

La única esperanza que tenía, había una pieza de evidencia que con la nueva tecnología de ADN quizá podría ser probada.

"That particular evidence had been tested previously and no DNA profile was able to be developed then. And with our current technologies, which are more sensitive, there was hope that we could develop a DNA profile. A partial male DNA profile was obtained from the swaps from Tiffany's body. The partial profile is a huge step forward, but has its limitations. You have to match it to specific samples. I had basically go and eliminate everyone who might have known Tiffany. While OSBI agents are gathering samples in Oklahoma, they reach out to Texas authorities to get a sample from William Reece. And that request gets the attention of investigators in Friendswood, who are starting a cold case review of Laura Smithers' murder. So in 2014, I was tasked with looking into the Laura Smithers case. That's when Josh and I started working together. There was two plans. One, and see if we could develop enough evidence to file charges on William Reece. Second plan was to help Oklahoma develop a strong enough case where their district attorney would file capital murder charges on William Reece, which would be an incentive for him maybe to give up some information in exchange for a life sentence versus was the death penalty.","Esa evidencia en particular había sido probada previamente y no se pudo desarrollar ningún perfil de ADN en ese entonces. Y con nuestras tecnologías actuales, que son más sensibles, había esperanza de que pudiéramos desarrollar un perfil de ADN. Se obtuvo un perfil parcial de ADN masculino de los hisopos del cuerpo de Tiffany. El perfil parcial es un gran avance, pero tiene sus limitaciones. Tienes que hacerlo coincidir con muestras específicas. Básicamente tuve que ir y eliminar a todos los que podrían haber conocido a Tiffany. Mientras los agentes de OSBI están recogiendo muestras en Oklahoma, se contactan con las autoridades de Texas para obtener una muestra de William Reece. Y esa solicitud llama la atención de los investigadores en Friendswood, quienes están comenzando una revisión de caso frío del asesinato de Laura Smithers. Así que en 2014, me encargaron investigar el caso de Laura Smithers. Fue entonces cuando Josh y yo comenzamos a trabajar juntos. Había dos planes. Uno, ver si podíamos desarrollar suficiente evidencia para presentar cargos contra William Reece. El segundo plan era ayudar a Oklahoma a desarrollar un caso lo suficientemente fuerte como para que su fiscal de distrito presentara cargos de asesinato capital contra William Reece, lo que podría ser un incentivo para que él quizá diera algo de información a cambio de una sentencia de por vida versus la pena de muerte.",0.009157904423773289,0.3265238404273987,0.0043419236317276955,0.3049713969230652,0.35023289918899536,0.004772058222442865,0.026949793100357056,0.8165060877799988,0.009318603202700615,0.09516246616840363,0.048140641301870346,0.00392242381349206
"Arned with that timeline of Reece's whereabouts, Friendswood investigators start working together with law enforcement investigating cold cases in places where Reece had visited. In all three cases, Kelly, Jessica, and Tiffany. They were able to find gas receipts, calling cards that put him nearby these locations where the women went missing. Meanwhile, OSBI has tested and eliminated all the other DNA samples they took in Tiffany's case against their partial DNA profile. It was not any of them. So I'm looking at a table full of numbers in each location where the evidence has results. The partial profile was consistent with Reese and nobody else. It's exciting. This case has been cold for so long, and there's finally an answer. In a cruel coincidence, Tiffany Johnston's mother, Kathy, knew William Reece personally. His parents lived across the street from them in Anadarko. Now, you had a relationship with his mother. Yes, his mother did my laundry for me while I was working. She pressed the I suppose that we were going to bury Tiffany in. Do you know if Tiffany knew William Reece? I don't believe Tiffany ever met William Reece. The evidence now suggests that somehow, Reece encountered Tiffany at the Sunshine car wash.","Armados con esa cronología de los paraderos de Reece, los investigadores de Friendswood comienzan a trabajar juntos con las fuerzas del orden que investigan casos fríos en lugares que Reece había visitado. En los tres casos, Kelly, Jessica y Tiffany. Lograron encontrar recibos de gasolina, tarjetas de llamadas que lo ubicaban cerca de estos lugares donde las mujeres desaparecieron. Mientras tanto, OSBI había probado y eliminado todas las otras muestras de ADN que tomaron en el caso de Tiffany contra su perfil parcial de ADN. No era ninguna de ellas. Así que estoy mirando una mesa llena de números en cada lugar donde la evidencia tiene resultados. El perfil parcial era consistente con Reese y nadie más. Es emocionante. Este caso ha estado frío durante tanto tiempo y finalmente hay una respuesta. En una cruel coincidencia, la madre de Tiffany Johnston, Kathy, conocía personalmente a William Reece. Sus padres vivían frente a ellos en Anadarko. Ahora, tenías una relación con su madre. Sí, su madre hacía mi lavandería mientras yo trabajaba. Ella presionó la supongo que íbamos a enterrar a Tiffany. ¿Sabes si Tiffany conocía a William Reece? No creo que Tiffany haya conocido a William Reece.

"That's really when things started moving a lot faster. The amount of information in the partial profile was enough for the DA to file charges. But we purposely waited because we knew that we, Maurice, was not going to get out of prison. The game plan was to allow Texas an opportunity to run their cases.

I didn't know what to do. I thought, maybe they're going to believe me. William Reece is behind bars in Texas, serving 60 years for kidnapping Sandra Sepau. Now, with the threat of a death penalty case for Tiffany Johnston's murder in Oklahoma looming over him, law enforcement in Texas decide to approach Reece to see if he will cooperate with their cases on Laura Smither, Kelly Cox, and Jessica Caine. My experience with suspects is if you can make them a good offer or a better offer than what they're about to receive, they usually take There may be consideration if he's willing to give up the locations of the remaining girls.","Eso es realmente cuando las cosas comenzaron a moverse mucho más rápido. La cantidad de información en el perfil parcial fue suficiente para que el fiscal presentara cargos. Pero esperamos a propósito porque sabíamos que nosotros, Maurice, no íbamos a salir de prisión.

Ahora, con la amenaza de un caso de pena de muerte por el asesinato de Tiffany Johnston en Oklahoma sobre él, las fuerzas del orden en Texas deciden acercarse a Reece para ver si colaborará con sus casos sobre Laura Smither, Kelly Cox y Jessica Caine.

"Originally, I always felt I was going to do the interview, right? The issue we had in all of that, William Reece hated Friendswood Police Department. That's right. So we had to come up with something else. Doug Bacon and I discussed who we'd like to use to make a run at William Reece. Reece was a cowboy, right?

"Wow. So that was one of those, Oh, jeez. He has given some indication that he was responsible for the murders of all four of these girls. Susie had been praying that exact thing just previously. All the families, we all talk to law enforcement. Bringing those two girls was very important to us. We'd taken the death Is he off the table. We okayed that. I said, If in fact, he takes you to where he buried Kelly and we can get her remains, that's fine. When Ranger Holland returns to meet Reese as agreed, Oklahoma is making any promises. They had not made a decision one way or the other, whether they would or they wouldn't pursue the death penalty. Although Reese is initially reluctant, he still agrees to give up the location of one of the missing women as a first step. At the end of the day, you don't have one chip. You've got two chips. Right. Okay. So you want one of them? Yeah. How can you want one? William Reece was released into Friinswood Police Department's custody. We first drove him. We said, That he buried Kelly Cox.

Habíamos quitado la pena de muerte de la mesa. Estábamos de acuerdo con eso. Dije, si de hecho, él te lleva a donde enterró a Kelly y podemos conseguir sus restos, está bien. Cuando el Ranger Holland vuelve a encontrarse con Reece como se acordó, Oklahoma no está haciendo promesas. No habían tomado una decisión de una forma u otra, si perseguirían o no la pena de muerte.

"Why did he choose this spot to bury her? There was a stolen bulldozer on site. So he had already had a bulldozer staged here that he was hiding out until he could sell it. That he had stolen. That's correct. As investigators begin to dig where Reece directs them, he settles into his own cell at the Friendswood Jail. So you get him to open up to you by appearing to be friendly with him.

"I flew upside in the building. Reece says he ran into that young mother, Kelly Cox, at the convenience store near the Denton Police Station.

I don't think I sprayed her, but she was cussing and everything. We started getting into verbal words back and forth.

"Yes, sir. Why? I don't I understand? Reece said, Hey, I'll take you directly to Jessica Caine's location because I know where I buried her because it's right by our pipeline.

Investigators are keeping a close eye on the dirt falling from the buckets, looking for anything out of the ordinary. All of these agencies had descended on this strip of land.

They were raising the bucket up, and there was just a little cylindrical piece of something. So we just had to stop. And it was a small bone fragment.

"Yeah, that's what skeptics say. They say there's no such thing as the Mark Aoki phenomenon, that actually it's it's people just have heard of it, and maybe she had some sort of Pavlovian training where like the smell of the books made her want to poop, but just talk about it. It getting published and becoming a thing in Japan, then traveling around the world, people started saying like, oh, yeah, I've pooped in bookstores too, So then anytime they poop in a bookstore from that point on they notice it. It confirms their theory that they're susceptible to the Ma Aoki phenomenon, and it just becomes like a self fulfilling prophecy. But at the same time they're also ignoring all the times they go to the bookstore and don't poop, or they go to pet Co and have to poop.

"My black and white Nike blazers hit the pavement in the parking lot of Men's Central Jail. Immediately I felt the warm sun on my skin as I stepped off the LA County bus. The word 'probation' was printed across the back of my shirt and down the side of my pants. A heavy silver chain had me bound at the wrist and another one restraining my ankles. There is a long road ahead of me. This is only the beginning. Right now I am not sure that there is a light at the end of this tunnel. I'm only 17 and as a female, I was full of emotion, but had to learn the art of masking. I was scared of the unknown. On my way to court, surrounded by all the women from Lynwood county dressed in all blue. The holding cells were packed with inmates on every side so much that corrections had nowhere to put me. Since I was a minor I had to be escorted.

"And then once I did it, I remember it was a really emotional day because I put my emotions down on paper. And one thing about being incarcerated is like sometimes that could be seen as like a form of weakness, or people will judge you.

Being in the situation that we were in. We were all considered unfit, which is the title of the piece. Because we weren't not fit to be charged as juveniles, we were being charged as adults. So as minors going through that situation. I think that writing class brought a lot of healing to all of us, because we were able to connect on that level.

And it made me it made me rethink everything. Like I had to read this. And then and then I really once I did that, I went back and did recorded another 10 songs. And just like, really, really explored the highly sensitive aspect in the album too.

I think it's hard to like build a relationship sometimes where you're like we are each other's only really foundation and it's sometimes it feels like it feels like people just kind of bail on it and also just too many people I think a lot of it is just like a numbers thing where like I think everyone knows that if they it doesn't work out there's there's enough people here today someone else and and then it ends up people end up like just moving on quicker.

"Okay, it's all started, you know, it always starts with, they may be out some rappers shit in Atlanta's like patrolling or whatever, you don't know what the hell's going on. And then I'm like a kid then it was like, oh casamigos is the shit. Like Castlevania has like a tense so much additives to it and like sugar and stuff. And this was this this came about because I was like, I couldn't figure out a drink, like, maybe I should just not drink the older I get, you know, I'm in my late 30s now, and I was like, I'm just like, not recovering well, and I'm like, I'm like, what is my drink and be like, I just want what like, how about James Bond has his one drink martini or whatever. I just want like a drink that I get when I go out, that's not gonna fuck me up. And it ended up being tequila. So now but then I was like doing Casamigos and I was still feeling sick or not sick but just like hungover and I was like, oh, just sugar in there. So then now we're at the where I'm at now is Don Julio is pretty good, every bar kind of has that. Then we got Fortaleza, which is amazing. And this one called Ojo, Tequila Ojo, which is my favorite tequila of all time, I love that, I love that one it's so smooth and I just yeah, just drink either neat or with a big rock, if they have the big rock. Some places they'll be having a big rock, I like to big rock. I don't like a lot of little rock because.","Ok, todo empezó, sabes, siempre empieza con, puede que haya algo de mierda de raperos en Atlanta como patrullando o lo que sea, no sabes qué diablos está pasando. Y entonces soy como un niño entonces era como, oh casamigos es la mierda. Como Castlevania tiene como una tensión tan mucha aditivos y como azúcar y cosas así. Y esto vino a colación porque estaba como, no podía encontrar una bebida, como, tal vez solo debería dejar de beber cuanto más viejo me hago, ya sabes, ahora estoy en mis 30 y tantos, y estaba como, simplemente como, no me recupero bien, y estoy como, estoy como, qué es mi bebida y sería como, solo quiero lo que como, cómo James Bond tiene su bebida un martini o lo que sea. Solo quiero una bebida que consiga cuando salgo, que no me vaya a joder. Y terminó siendo tequila. Así que ahora pero entonces estaba haciendo Casamigos y todavía me sentía mal o no enfermo pero como con resaca y estaba como, oh, solo azúcar allí. Así que entonces ahora estamos en donde estoy ahora es Don Julio es bastante bueno, cada bar lo tiene más o menos. Luego conseguimos Fortaleza, que es increíble.

Like, there's a lot of reasons that that works or you get to a certain point you have, maybe you have kids that you have to take care of all of these things, and suddenly, your priorities are different.

"I think she would have been a front runner in the contest click yeah, for sure. But yeah, like one year for my birthday, she forgot my presents. And we would always go camping for my birthday. And she panicked. We were camping two and a half hours from home in the mountains in north central Idaho. So she went to the gift shop at the little campground. And she found all these little tchotchkes and little Bitsy things, and she scavenged her way through the campground and begged of these random strangers to hide some of these presents admits their belongings.

That was kind of an awkward, like, my momâs just going to do this on her own kind of thing. And I donât remember how they scraped up the money to like, make the bakery. I donât remember how any of that stuff, like worked out but she started this bakery and it was wildly successful from the get go.

"She had started doing like booking wedding cakes out almost like a year in advance because she was so popular. And her cakes were so good. Everything was from scratch. The frosting was amazing. And so she had booked this cake and it was the most expensive cake sheâd done to date, I think it was 2500 bucks, which in the 80s holy shit, like who pays that? I donât even know even today. Iâm like, who are you people but and it had these white chocolate ribbons all around it that sheâd had to make from scratch like by hand, you know, sheâs like hand forming these ribbons around these like metal dowels and trying to get them to shape just right and everything. So it took her like three days to make this cake, it was unreal. And she was delivering it at this ballroom. And they had just wax the floor and they didnât have a sign up. And she was carrying the bass, which was like over 50 pounds. It was huge. And she didnât have anyone helping her. And she went to take a step in the ballroom to start crossing the floor and she like absolute acid over teakettle flipped up in the air. And she hit the ground with the full force like on her lower back. And she saved the cake. There were like two little thumb holes in either side of the base of the cake because she was so frantic about how much money that cake cost, what that would represent if she had to kind of give them a reimbursement or whatever. And also, she was, I think, heavily cognizant of this being someoneâs special day and she didnât want to ruin it, so she was like, oh, shit. So she predicted the cake at all costs and took the hit on her back and ended up severing a fusion that sheâd had done a couple years prior in her lower back or lumbar spine. And then additionally, it broke her pelvis. But they didnât identify that her pelvis was broken until a couple of months after, but she was in exorbitant pain the whole entire time and couldnât figure out why. And so she went back in and they did I think get an MRI or whatever the hell they do, and they were like, oh, thatâs less than ideal. And they had to go in and break it and refix it like reef, set it basically. So for about nine months, she was kind of, you know, at a commission and off her feet, and everybody else was still kind of working at the bakery, like the employees and the business partner that she had found. But they werenât her. All the recipes were in her head. Like she knew how long to whip the butter before adding the sugar to make it really fluffy, you know, for the frosting. And so people didnât know what she knew. And they werenât able to keep up with the demand. She ended up having to sell her share of the bakery. And I donât remember how much money it ended up being but it was like a pittance. But it was like nothing compared to what sheâd put into it. And I remember that being like a sharp right turn of the before her and the after her. I think it like a level of bitterness was exposed that I hadnât seen before.","Ella habÃ­a comenzado a reservar pasteles de boda con casi un aÃ±o de anticipaciÃ³n porque era muy popular. Y sus pasteles eran tan buenos. Todo era desde cero. El glaseado era increÃ­ble. Y asÃ­ reservÃ³ este pastel y fue el pastel mÃ¡s caro que habÃ­a hecho hasta la fecha, creo que eran 2500 dÃ³lares, que en los aÃ±os 80 era una barbaridad, como Â¿quiÃ©n paga eso?

Y ella estaba cargando la base, que pesaba mÃ¡s de 50 libras. Era enorme. Y no tenÃ­a a nadie que la ayudara. Y fue a dar un paso en el salÃ³n de baile para comenzar a cruzar el piso y se volteÃ³ completamente en el aire. Y cayÃ³ al suelo con toda la fuerza en la parte baja de la espalda. Y salvÃ³ el pastel. HabÃ­a como dos pequeÃ±os agujeros de pulgares en cada lado de la base del pastel porque estaba tan frenÃ©tica por cuÃ¡nto costaba el pastel, lo que representarÃ­a si tuviera que darles un reembolso o lo que sea. Y ademÃ¡s, estaba, creo, muy consciente de que era el dÃ­a especial de alguien y no querÃ­a arruinarlo, asÃ­ que estaba como, oh, mierda. AsÃ­ que protegiÃ³ el pastel a toda costa y recibiÃ³ el golpe en su espalda y terminÃ³ cortando una fusiÃ³n que le habÃ­an hecho un par de aÃ±os antes en su columna lumbar. Y ademÃ¡s, se rompiÃ³ la pelvis. Pero no identificaron que su pelvis estaba rota hasta un par de meses despuÃ©s, pero ella estuvo en dolor exorbitante todo el tiempo y no podÃ­a entender por quÃ©. Y entonces volviÃ³ y creo que le hicieron una resonancia magnÃ©tica o lo que sea que hagan, y estaban como, oh, eso es menos que ideal.

Pero no eran ella. Todas las recetas estaban en su cabeza. Como ella sabÃ­a cuÃ¡nto tiempo batir la mantequilla antes de agregar el azÃºcar para que el glaseado fuera realmente esponjoso. Y entonces la gente no sabÃ­a lo que ella sabÃ­a. Y no pudieron mantenerse al dÃ­a con la demanda. TerminÃ³ teniendo que vender su parte de la panaderÃ­a.

"Yeah, I think the fights with my parents got a lot more aggressive, they got a lot more violent, they got a lot more frequent. There was this moment where my parents were fighting. And my mom was just absolutely badgering the shit out of my dad. And I was like, screaming at them to stop fighting. And she reached up to like, I donât know what she was going to do to him. But she ended up climbing the whole side of his face. And it was like a plate open like a bear. Like it looked like a bear had gotten him. And I was like, what in the fuck just happened? I remember being so terrified. And I was so mad at my dad, because he didnât stop it. Like, he was always taking it from her. And it was always one sided in terms of that level of aggression and like maliciousness, and I could never understand, like, what the hell was going on. And that day, my dad grabbed me by the arm, because I was in the hallway, like kind of causing a scene and trying to get them to stop and seeing if I could distract the action. And he grabbed the keys. And he just ran out the front door. And we left and we went to this little diner, like a half a mile from home, if we could have run into 80 million people that we knew, I donât know why he picked that place, probably. His adrenaline was just dumping and we sat there and my dad said, you canât be mad at your mom for this. You canât be mad at her for this, you donât know what sheâs been through. And I remember just thinking, I donât care what sheâs been through. She doesnât need to act like that you know, and he told me some stories about my momâs childhood and what she had lived through and gone through and, and they were horrendous stories. I remember sitting there trying to eat my french toast and being like, it felt it felt like watching a TV show. Like it didnât feel like this is my mom heâs talking about it felt like some weird like, person off in the distance. And youâre like watching this narrative. And youâre like, wow, thatâs, I donât even know how to take that in. So he was really trying to compensate for like the bullshit of how she was showing up.

"They have this weird like corner pantry in the kitchen that was kind of blocking the view from the inside. This was before like open concept floor plans were a thing. And he was like if we take this pantry down, you know itâll really open up the room. So maybe we take this pantry out and just like put a big island here. And so they did that and they put in granite countertops. Like they put all this work into the house. They painted it, he did a three color color scheme for the paint. There was like beige, this really pretty like ivory and then this neat foresty Green was like the accent color. Everything heâd done was top notch. It looked absolutely incredible, youâd never know they didnât hire a contractor to do this work and I remember kind of thinking at the time, like how do I get the money to pay for this? Because my stepdad was on disability. My mom is on disability because of all the back stuff that sheâd suffered her entire life. And she was never able to work again after the injuries that she sustained from delivering that wedding cake so I thought it was weird, but I didnât really think anything of it at the time. And I was back in Washington I bought condo, a really cute little condo loved it. And I think it was, like $158,000 or something that is just obscene to think about these days but the problem was when I had gotten a loan for this condo it was it had an adjustable rate mortgage, I had an arm because I had the burden of my parents house hanging on my credit. And I still didnât fully understand like the ramifications of what that meant but I was assured, like, if you make good payments, you have good payment history. If your parents keep making the payment in in Boise like, youâll be fine, youâll be able to refinance this adjustable rate. And when itâs ready, youâll refinance, youâll be good to go.","TenÃ­an este raro armario en la esquina de la cocina que estaba bloqueando la vista desde el interior.

"Okay, let me attempt to explain what a short sale is, with the caveat that I am not a realtor, just a lady with a podcast and a lot of feelings who will give this her best shot. So a short sale is when a homeowner who finds themselves in dire straits like Alyssa and her mom decides to sell their home for less than what they owe on the mortgage, the mortgage lender benefits by getting all of the proceeds from the sale. And in turn, they forgive the difference altogether, or the homeowner has to pay whatâs leftover, Alyssa has to do the latter. So she is still stuck paying some money. But itâs a way better deal than a straight up foreclosure. And at this point, Alyssa just wants an out. So itâs the best of some not great options.","Ok, dÃ©jame intentar explicar quÃ© es una venta corta, con la advertencia de que no soy agente inmobiliario, solo una mujer con un podcast y muchos sentimientos que lo harÃ¡ lo mejor que pueda. Una venta corta es cuando un propietario que se encuentra en apuros, como Alyssa y su madre, decide vender su casa por menos de lo que deben en la hipoteca, el prestamista hipotecario se beneficia al obtener todos los ingresos de la venta. Y a cambio, perdonan la diferencia por completo, o el propietario tiene que pagar lo que queda, Alyssa tiene que hacer lo Ãºltimo. AsÃ­ que todavÃ­a estÃ¡ atascada pagando algo de dinero. Pero es una mejor oferta que una ejecuciÃ³n hipotecaria directa. Y en este punto, Alyssa solo quiere una salida. AsÃ­ que es lo mejor de algunas opciones no tan grandes.",0.9875478744506836,0.0024983063340187073,0.0003918160800822079,0.004488774109631777,0.004764849320054054,0.00030849085305817425,0.02896699123084545,0.6200741529464722,0.0061045316979289055,0.2941763401031494,0.04756096377968788,0.0031169517897069454
"We ended up selling the house for I think like $73,000, or something like that it was very low. Considering what the house was worth, I think the house was worth like, over 200 at the time, because they put so much into it and it had appreciated and it was such a good area. I mean, my God, if we had that house to this day, it would probably be worth like close to 600,000 for the location it is and and what it afforded but whatever. So short sale happens, new people take possession of the home, they move in. And I get a notification from the mortgage company as weâre finishing up all the paperwork, that thereâs a big discrepancy in the value, because there had been a home equity line of credit attached to the property. And I was like, what is that? No, there wasnât like, what are you talking about? And that through that process, I discovered that my mom had stolen my identity, used my social security number, and my date of birth and forged my signature and got a home equity line of credit for $75,000. And that was how they afforded the hardwood floors and the granite countertops and the paint and the new garage door. And like all the beautiful things that they did to the house was through the $75,000 loan that I didnât know theyâd acquired. And so Iâm thinking the difference between the short sale and what the loan was for originally is this much not very much money, and then I find out oh no add 75,000 to that it is a lot of money and it ended up being well over $100,000 that the mortgage was shorted when the sale happened. And so the mortgage company filed that judgment against me for I think it was like $110,000 something obscene maybe more maybe like 117 and I mean literally like mental blackhole for these details because it was so fucking traumatizing. And I was so spun up with trying to figure out like, how am I going to save where I live? What am I going to do with my condo like I had no idea. And at that like moment in time hashtag 2008, the rate adjusted on my condo, and the payment almost doubled, and my income didnât double but the payment doubled. And at that same time the short sale had finally been registered and there was literally nothing I could do to refinance my condo. So I was like, okay, I better figure out how to make that work. So I pulled myself up and found a realtor tried to sell it. Nothing, nothing, nothing. We ended up dropping the price to $53,000. And no offers no offers, no one would take it. And it went into full foreclosure. At the time, like I was making my car payment, I was making my credit card payment, like a cell phone payment utilities. And I, I knew like this is a steep cliff. And I donât understand whatâs on the other side of it. But I also remember just being like kind of disassociated from it, because how do you come back from this? What do you even do? Like, what is the next step? It was so terrifying and traumatic. My momâs mortgage company filed a judgment against me for all that money than I had a full foreclosure on my credit, and I had no choice but to declare bankruptcy. And when that reality hit, it was like being dunked in ice water with a brick on top of your head, like thereâs no way to come out. And I thought for sure my life was completely over. And clearly, like my mom is, is gone from my life again, like I was so furious that this circumstance was what was happening. And it it sucked, because I couldnât talk about it with anyone. Because everyone would be pithy and judgmental with their shitty comments of well, yeah, thatâs why you donât ever use your credit for anyone else. Well, yeah, and thatâs why you should never cosign a loan for anyone. Well, yeah, thatâs why I mean, it was just this endless refrain of like, Youâre a fucking idiot. Whyâd you do that to begin with. And thatâs not helpful. I mean, no one fully understood that frame of reference of having this awesome mom, that goes downhill, climbs back up, makes it up, gets better, seems like sheâs doing okay. And then boom, right back down again. So, I mean, I thought I was doing the right thing, by pulling them up, and helping them be successful homeowners. And I donât know, I think like you say things like, I couldnât have foreseen that this would happen. But like, I really couldnât, at the time I was in my early 20s, I was young, I didnât think that this would be what happens to me.","Terminamos vendiendo la casa por, creo, como $73,000, o algo asÃ­, fue muy bajo. Considerando lo que valÃ­a la casa, creo que la casa valÃ­a como, mÃ¡s de 200 en ese momento, porque habÃ­an invertido tanto en ella y habÃ­a apreciado y estaba en una buena Ã¡rea. Quiero decir, Dios mÃ­o, si tuviÃ©ramos esa casa hasta el dÃ­a de hoy, probablemente valdrÃ­a cerca de 600,000 por la ubicaciÃ³n que tiene y lo que ofrecÃ­a pero bueno. AsÃ­ que sucede la venta corta, la gente nueva toma posesiÃ³n de la casa, se mudan. Y recibo una notificaciÃ³n de la compaÃ±Ã­a hipotecaria mientras terminamos todo el papeleo, que hay una gran discrepancia en el valor, porque habÃ­a una lÃ­nea de crÃ©dito sobre el valor lÃ­quido de la propiedad adjunta a la propiedad. Y yo estaba como, Â¿quÃ© es eso? No, no habÃ­a como, Â¿de quÃ© estÃ¡s hablando? Y a travÃ©s de ese proceso, descubrÃ­ que mi madre habÃ­a robado mi identidad, usÃ³ mi nÃºmero de seguridad social, mi fecha de nacimiento y falsificÃ³ mi firma y obtuvo una lÃ­nea de crÃ©dito sobre el valor lÃ­quido de la casa por $75,000. Y asÃ­ fue como pudieron pagar los pisos de madera y las encimeras de granito y la pintura y la nueva puerta del garaje. Y como todas las cosas hermosas que hicieron a la casa fue a travÃ©s del prÃ©stamo de $75,000 que yo no sabÃ­a que habÃ­an adquirido. Y asÃ­ estoy pensando que la diferencia entre la venta corta y lo que originalmente era el prÃ©stamo es esta cantidad, no mucho dinero, y luego descubro que no, agrega 75,000 a eso, es mucho dinero y terminÃ³ siendo mucho mÃ¡s de $100,000 que faltaban en la hipoteca cuando ocurriÃ³ la venta. Y asÃ­ la compaÃ±Ã­a hipotecaria presentÃ³ esa sentencia contra mÃ­ por creo que era como $110,000 algo obsceno tal vez mÃ¡s tal vez como 117 y quiero decir literalmente como un agujero negro mental para estos detalles porque fue tan jodidamente traumÃ¡tico. Y estaba tan confundida tratando de averiguar como, Â¿cÃ³mo voy a salvar donde vivo? Â¿QuÃ© voy a hacer con mi condominio como no tenÃ­a idea. Y en ese momento, hashtag 2008, la tasa ajustada en mi condominio, y el pago casi se duplicÃ³, y mi ingreso no se duplicÃ³ pero el pago se duplicÃ³. Y al mismo tiempo, la venta corta finalmente se habÃ­a registrado y literalmente no habÃ­a nada que pudiera hacer para refinanciar mi condominio. AsÃ­ que estaba como, bueno, mejor averiguo cÃ³mo hacer que funcione. AsÃ­ que me levantÃ© y encontrÃ© un agente inmobiliario tratÃ© de venderlo. Nada, nada, nada. Terminamos bajando el precio a $53,000. Y no ofertas, no ofertas, nadie lo tomarÃ­a. Y entrÃ³ en ejecuciÃ³n hipotecaria completa. En ese momento, como estaba haciendo mi pago del coche, estaba haciendo mi pago de la tarjeta de crÃ©dito, como un pago de telÃ©fono celular, utilidades. Y yo, sabÃ­a como esto es un acantilado empinado. Y no entiendo quÃ© hay del otro lado de eso. Pero tambiÃ©n recuerdo estar como un poco disociado de eso, porque Â¿cÃ³mo te recuperas de esto? Â¿QuÃ© haces? Â¿CuÃ¡l es el siguiente paso? Era tan aterrador y traumÃ¡tico. La compaÃ±Ã­a hipotecaria de mi madre presentÃ³ una sentencia contra mÃ­ por todo ese dinero que tenÃ­a una ejecuciÃ³n hipotecaria completa en mi crÃ©dito, y no tuve mÃ¡s remedio que declararme en bancarrota. Y cuando esa realidad golpeÃ³, fue como ser sumergido en agua helada con un ladrillo encima de tu cabeza, como no hay forma de salir. Y pensÃ© que mi vida estaba completamente terminada. Y claramente, como mi madre, estÃ¡ fuera de mi vida otra vez, estaba tan furiosa que esta circunstancia fuera lo que estaba sucediendo. Y apesta, porque no podÃ­a hablar de ello con nadie. Porque todos serÃ­an mordaces y crÃ­ticos con sus comentarios de mierda de bueno, sÃ­, por eso nunca usas tu crÃ©dito para nadie mÃ¡s. Bueno, sÃ­, y por eso nunca deberÃ­as co-firmar un prÃ©stamo para nadie. Bueno, sÃ­, es solo este estribillo interminable de como, Eres un jodido idiota. Â¿Por quÃ© hiciste eso para empezar? Y eso no ayuda. Quiero decir, nadie entendiÃ³ completamente ese marco de referencia de tener esta increÃ­ble madre, que cae en picado, se recupera, mejora, parece que estÃ¡ bien.

"And then from that moment forward, like everything you had to your name that revolved around your social security number is kind of like it either disappears, or, in some cases, like student loans donât go away. That was a kindness, such a kindness, to get to keep all of those. So I kept my $55,000 in student loan debt. But other than my car, and my student loans, everything else disappeared. So I didnât have a credit card to my name. Think about like the economic stability that a credit card affords you, like you have the ability to carry that buffer. And even though itâs gonna suck, and youâll have to pay it back, you still at least know mentally, youâre secure in the knowledge that youâve got away to carry yourself through a situation that could come up a car repair, something like that, or, you know, a medical bill, in my case, like needing a different inhaler, or whatever, like, how do you pay for this shit? And I had to recognize, what do you do when you have to live without that? And I felt so precariously at risk at all times? Because Iâm constantly thinking, oh, my God, what if I need new tires, I have no way to pay for new tires. I had no savings, youâre not allowed to have savings. Because if you had savings, you needed to put it towards your debts. And so I had no backing for anything. Should anything pop up that I needed to like financially cover. I think my credit score dropped to 200. After the bankruptcy, it might even be lower than that. I mean, it was like, what is that? Is that a thing? How does that work? So I got approved for this unsecured like credit card. And the interest rate, I think I swear to God, it was like 35.8%. So if you use it like Jesus, a third of what you just spend is your next like interest bomb. So it was miserable but slowly, I had to incrementally kind of like find those little bitty footholds that could help me secure a little bit more credit bit by bit at a time. So I would use that ought to like buy gum. And then I would make the payment. And then like, just for the sake of like, Iâm making payments, look at my payment history, Iâm a good person. And it really was that Iâm a good person that kind of pulled me through because I felt like such a shitty person for having to live like this and having to be this burden on society.","Y luego, desde ese momento en adelante, como todo lo que tenÃ­as a tu nombre que giraba en torno a tu nÃºmero de seguro social es como si desapareciera, o, en algunos casos, como los prÃ©stamos estudiantiles no desaparecen.

"I think it did for a long time. I think it kind of took root and it. It was like, omnipresent, like, you know, bitterness and anxiety and frustration and fear.

"It was 2020, and it was in November, I think November, December. And I remember because my now husband was sitting on the couch. And I got an email from Credit Karma. And it said, Congratulations, your scores increased. And I was like, well, thatâs like a weird, like, what non sequitur kind of, you know, timing for your credit score to go up. So whatever, I opened the email, I log in, and I scroll down. And thereâs always like the section where itâs like, hereâs your green part, the good part, hereâs your positive part, hereâs your yellow part, yellow was always like your balances too high. Weâll think student loans, like my balance is always going to look too high but and then you scroll down to the bottom where the red is. And itâs like anything thatâs delinquent or deficient and the bankruptcy had always been there. And so I like scroll scrolls, thereâs no red. There was like, no red spot anymore on my Credit Karma profile. And I like screamed, and he was like, what is wrong? And I was like, oh, my God, oh, my God, look, and I like held the phone up to him. And he was like, what is that? And I was like, itâs gone. And he was like, I donât know whatâs gone. And Iâm like, the bankruptcy is gone. Like, and it just felt like I like Iâm almost crying because the moment that lifted, I was like, oh my god, new life. This is like a literal, new life. Like, I donât have to see it anymore. I donât have to feel it anymore. I donât have to be shamed anymore. Holy fuck, Iâm free, like, Iâm free. Like, Iâm done with this thing. Itâs gone.

"Instead of arguing with reality, Stephanie, I will harken back to Harrisâs comedic roots and the improv principle of Yes, and and I will say yes and you cannot fight reality, you cannot argue with reality, because reality will always win that war.

You just need to let it go. You need to let it go. And what has happened is done canât be undone. And that is reality.

"We had been kind of on the same page, kind of CO managing finances. And when our kids were born, I donât know, for some reason, something shifted to me, and it stressed me out and heâs like, it doesnât stress me out, Iâll take care of it. So I kind of passed that baton to him. As many, you know, relationships are someone each of you divide and conquer your tasks. And so I would call him and say like, the car just got to class. Heâs like, Oh, I think weâve got some fraud on it. And you know, that I then suddenly it would work. Or I would go to try to log into our bank account, and I couldnât get in. And, you know, he would always be the ones that call and try to figure out what was going on. And like, thereâs a problem with the website, and you would forward me emails showing me like, hereâs where I talked to the banker, and theyâre trying to get this fixed, and theyâre gonna pay us a fee for the inconvenience. And my remember my momâs saying, that doesnât make any sense. Why would they pay you instead of just fixing it? And I was like, Well, itâs because itâs been going on for so long. Itâs taking a while for them to figure it out. I mean, even statements, you know, this was the time where everyone was starting to do online statements. And so statements didnât really come to our house anymore for anything. And we always had the Postal Service informed delivery, and you get an email every morning telling you whatâs coming in the mail that day. And I this is one of the things that still bothers me to this day used to always tell me donât check the mail today, I got you a present. Itâs gonna be there. And hindsight, because then a couple of weeks, Iâd be like, Whatever happened to that present? Oh, I know. You wouldnât like it. I sent it back. And I think he would see what was getting delivered that day and itâd be something he didnât want me to see. And so he would tell me there was a present for me, and sometimes there was there was presence enough that it was believable, right. So here I think my sweet husband is getting me a gift. Itâs not my birthday. Itâs not our anniversary. Thereâs some special occasion. Who am I to doubt him?","HabÃ­amos estado mÃ¡s o menos en la misma pÃ¡gina, coadministrando las finanzas.

"I never worried about an affair. I did a couple times wonder just because of the account things if it was money.

Like, what should I worry about, because I donât have anything that happened today, I will go into my minds into the dredges of my brain. And I will find something to ruminate on and ruin my day over.

"So I get home from the trip. And one of the women that I was with her husband had been friends with Joe. And we got home maybe on a Monday, Wednesday morning, she sends me a text and she said I need to talk to you. You canât be at home. So I said okay, I said Iâm gonna go run an errand. And I went up the street just parked in a parking lot. And she told me a story. She got back and told her husband and he said, I have to tell you something. He said back in 2017. Joe came to me and asked me for a six figure loan to watch. I said, Man, I canât do that. But what is going on? Like, are you guys okay, whatâs happening? Then he gave him some story about needing to pay a loan back to his employer or something and, and our friend tried to talk to him, heâs like, itâs fine, dude, everythingâs fine. And and Joe left. So our friend goes and looks at Joeâs company website and sees him listed as an employee there. And then a few days later, he saw him at his kids school event and said, Hey, is everything okay? Itâs like, and Joe at a super nonchalant, like he had never asked for the loan. brushed it off, everythingâs fine. What are you talking about? And he went and checked the website again. And Joe was no longer listed as an employee. He never told his wife because he didnât think it was his place to get involved. And Joe had told him this in confidence. So he was trying to keep the confidence of a friend. But when she came back from the trip and knew this, heâs like, I have to tell you, because I think Carrie needs to know what happened a couple of years ago. So I go home. And I say, Joe, did you lose your job in August of 2017? And he looks at me, he goes, why? I said, Just answer the question. And he looks at me and he says, Yeah. And I said, you got up every morning and went to work. Where were you going? I would just go sit at a coffee shop all day. I said, I was only working part time, our daughter was doing a competitive sport, we were paying for preschool for our son. We went on multiple trips, the money was coming into the account. And thatâs when I realized that he had been withdrawing money from my Roth, my 401k.

Y luego, unos dÃ­as despuÃ©s, lo vio en un evento escolar de sus hijos y dijo, Oye, Â¿todo estÃ¡ bien? Es como, y Joe de una manera super casual, como si nunca hubiera pedido el prÃ©stamo. Lo desestimÃ³, todo estÃ¡ bien. Â¿De quÃ© estÃ¡s hablando? Y fue y revisÃ³ el sitio web de nuevo. Y Joe ya no estaba listado como empleado.

Some families have two moms and some have two dads or some families decide that their family will be healthier if the mom and dad donât live together anymore. And I said this is what your dad and I have decided and my nine year olds daddyâs girl she understood right away and was pretty hysterical crying. And my five year old was just looking around. And when he saw his sister cry, he started crying. I donât think he really understood what it meant. But they both, you know, they cried and and she just kept asking why, why. And I said, sometimes adults just canât make things work and their adult problems, theyâre not your problems to have to bear. And weâre gonna be here for you every step of the way. And I did all the talking. And he just sat there, weâre living under the same roof. And heâd say, I have a work event tonight, and he would go out and he would stay out all night. But he would come home before the kids woke up with a dozen doughnuts from the bakery down the street and the data here, and I donât know what he was doing, whoâs with.

"I am in a much better space. When I was going through the divorce. My attorney advised me that I basically had two options we could file police reports. I mean, there was clearly mail fraud at the very least here, identity theft and all those things. But itâd be difficult to prove because a lot of Eddie had my social my username, my password, my electronic signature, or we could write a settlement into my divorce. And at the time, I had decision fatigue, I was so worn down, I said, letâs just do the settlement. So there was a fee, we came up with it. And it didnât account for all the retirement savings, but the debts that we could find, where we added up a total and said, you have to pay this much a month for this many months. And regardless of whether he declares bankruptcy or whatever, he has to pay it, and went with that. And then I got a notebook. And on every page I wrote, this is this debtor, this is how much I owe them, theyâve offered me to only pay this much back, hereâs how much I can pay them back. And I for the for it was a full time job, okay, itâs the 12th of the month, I have to call these people and pay $1,000 To get this debt down. And then I owed my parents a lot of money because they paid for my booth here, they paid for my first and last monthâs rent, they and I busted my ass, and I saved and scrimps and did everything I could and I have, Iâm in a much better spot, my credit is fine. I was my kids and I moved to the summer to a new home. And let me tell you how amazing it felt when I applied and they credit checked me and I got approved on my own, with no help from anyone. And itâs only been three years and I felt like a million bucks.","Estoy en un lugar mucho mejor.

"Well, I have proven to myself how capable I am. I think I defaulted to letting him do so much. You know, programming the garage door, I can do that. I did it. It seems so stupid. But I did it. I changed out a toilet lid without a man to help me I do the grocery shopping, I pay the bills. I do literally everything. And I work and Iâve really challenging career full time.

And this woman was talking about the book, The Secret Garden. And in the musical version, there was a point where they sing a song and in the song may say, itâs the storm, not you thatâs bound to blow away. And during the midst of this, when things were really bad, there were days where I would have to get up to get the kids on the bus. And I felt like my head weighed a million pounds. And sometimes the only thing that got me through the day was chanting storm. Not you, Storm, not you. And itâs so cheesy, but it it it still has been my mantra to this day. Anything that comes my way. I feel overwhelmed still, but I know Iâm not going to go away I would have already and Iâm still going to be here. And thatâs kind of what I want other people to know too with. When youâre in it feels like youâre never going to live through it. But you will.

Y esta mujer estaba hablando sobre el libro, El Jardín Secreto. Y en la versión musical, había un punto donde cantan una canción y en la canción dicen, es la tormenta, no tú, la que está destinada a desaparecer. Y en medio de esto, cuando las cosas estaban realmente mal, había días en los que tenía que levantarme para llevar a los niños al autobús. Y sentía que mi cabeza pesaba un millón de libras. Y a veces lo único que me hacía pasar el día era cantar tormenta. No tú, Tormenta, no tú. Y es tan cursi, pero sigue siendo mi mantra hasta hoy. Cualquier cosa que venga en mi camino.

"I am. Iâm trying to meet people. Iâm on a lot of dating apps and stuff like that. But I guess I grew up with like an idealized version of like, what dating would be like, but I didnât date for so long. While I was not dating, people moved into like a swipe culture or things moving a lot more quickly than maybe I was prepared for or used to, especially, you know, when I was first transitioning, and things like that. So itâs been interesting to think about, but like, that would hit me hard. I was like, oh, the whole dating game has changed. I kind of missed out on it. Before I came out publicly, I didnât really see a romantic future because I wasnât being myself. And I wasnât being true to myself. And I guess one of the reasons I ventured out to Los Angeles, is because I am hoping to date and find a partner. On the flip side, dating as a trans person has been incredibly difficult. Iâll match with people and then theyâll read my profile, and theyâll quickly unmatch. Or, like, Iâll be talking with someone like a guy or girl and I like trying to get together. I was like, hey, letâs meet up for a drink. Theyâre like, cool your place? And Iâm like, no, I would rather like go out for a drink or coffee or something like that.

"Dating as a trans person is hard. And another thing thatâs layered on top of that, is that Iâm still trying to figure out my sexuality, which I guess is kind of open ended, even though I never would have admitted that before transitioning. All of this is pretty intimidating. And Iâm hoping that a city as progressive as Los Angeles is the right place to figure this out.","Salir en citas siendo una persona trans es difÃ­cil.

"I can hear you. Can you hear me? Me and my girlfriend Emma are navigating a long-distance relationship right now because she is currently studying to be a helicopter pilot. So living long distance is hard enough as it is. But then with touring and being on the road all the time. Itâs hard to kind of match up schedules and just make time for each other. But I try to always catch her between gigs. Well, the show went really well tonight. Yeah, it was good. It was like actually a totally decent turnout for what it was. It was like 45 people. I went awesome. The people who booked me were like, super nice. I warned them that like hey, it might get awkward. And they were like we love awkward. So it was really fun. And now Iâm navigating through the college town and all of its little roundabouts because itâs hip, and itâs a college town and they got roundabouts and trying to get back to the highway so that I can fly out in I donât know what five hours maybe a two-hour drive back to the airport. Iâve got to drop the rental car off. And itâs not enough time even though they gave me a hotel room for tonight. I donât have enough time to stay there. So instead Iâm gonna go to the airport and I was going to try and like sleep there but this airport closes from like the life of a comic is, itâs insane. And while I know it, and Iâve done it a lot, it never really gets easier. Yeah, I do have to go find a place and fill up so they donât charge me out the wazoo for gas at the rental car place.

"Oh my gosh, thatâs the worst part of it. Being on the road is already crappy enough. Youâre the only one to keep yourself accountable and sober when youâre traveling and on the road. But then add on that youâre trans and youâre traveling to small cities. Some of them arenât as progressive as Los Angeles. And Iâm being super honest, on stage about being trans. Just wears on you a lot. I just am not as happy on the road doing comedy anymore. I mean, honestly, I donât know. Itâs really hard. Because every time I try to leave stand up, it feels like an opportunity comes that kind of pulls me back in. Youâre doing what you love. And people are loving what youâre doing. And you see the reactions. And secondly, it really was like being able to give back and do comedy at the same time. I get that like so I would do typically an hour show then I would do the 30 Minute Q&A, okay. And then I also said on stage, if you are too shy also to come up to me after the show I completely understand. And those are the times where like, people after meeting me sometimes cried and dealt with their problems or learned stuff about being trans. I had this show that Iâll never ever forget. I did a regular show on a college campus. And I got a message after I was done. That said, hey, Jeffrey. I am the 45-year-old man who is at your show yesterday. And I want to let you know, I have always truly felt like a woman. And for an hour and a half yesterday, for the first time in 45 years, I felt normal. So it was important to me that I go to any town, if something were to happen and didnât matter, being willing to be that person is really important to me. This person reached out to me, theyâve just looking for an outlet and someone to talk to. And so you can be there for them for a second. But like, you know, theyâre still dealing with it when you leave. Theyâre still dealing with their own lives and a small town. So","Dios mÃ­o, esa es la peor parte. Estar en la carretera ya es bastante malo. Eres el Ãºnico que se mantiene responsable y sobrio cuando estÃ¡s viajando y en la carretera. Pero luego aÃ±ade que eres trans y viajas a ciudades pequeÃ±as. Algunas de ellas no son tan progresistas como Los Ãngeles. Y estoy siendo sÃºper honesto, en el escenario sobre ser trans. Eso te desgasta mucho. Simplemente no soy tan feliz en la carretera haciendo comedia como antes. Quiero decir, honestamente, no sÃ©. Es realmente difÃ­cil. Porque cada vez que intento dejar el stand-up, parece que surge una oportunidad que de alguna manera me vuelve a atraer. EstÃ¡s haciendo lo que amas. Y a la gente le encanta lo que haces. Y ves las reacciones. Y en segundo lugar, realmente era como poder devolver algo y hacer comedia al mismo tiempo. Entiendo eso, asÃ­ que normalmente harÃ­a un espectÃ¡culo de una hora y luego harÃ­a una sesiÃ³n de preguntas y respuestas de 30 minutos, estÃ¡ bien. Y tambiÃ©n dije en el escenario, si eres demasiado tÃ­mido tambiÃ©n para acercarte a mÃ­ despuÃ©s del espectÃ¡culo, lo entiendo completamente. Y esos son los momentos en los que, como, despuÃ©s de conocerme, algunas personas a veces lloraron y enfrentaron sus problemas o aprendieron cosas sobre ser trans. Tuve este espectÃ¡culo que nunca olvidarÃ©. Hice un espectÃ¡culo regular en un campus universitario. Y recibÃ­ un mensaje despuÃ©s de que terminÃ©. Que decÃ­a, hola, Jeffrey. Soy el hombre de 45 aÃ±os que estuvo en tu espectÃ¡culo ayer. Y quiero que sepas que siempre me he sentido realmente como una mujer. Y durante una hora y media ayer, por primera vez en 45 aÃ±os, me sentÃ­ normal. AsÃ­ que era importante para mÃ­ ir a cualquier ciudad, si algo pasara y no importara, estar dispuesto a ser esa persona es realmente importante para mÃ­. Esta persona se puso en contacto conmigo, solo buscaban una salida y alguien con quien hablar. Y asÃ­ puedes estar ahÃ­ para ellos por un segundo.
